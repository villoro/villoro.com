brief: |
  The idea of this project was to create a Computer Vision (CV) pipeline.

  In the first part I explored some CV techniques to detect faces or edges. I also learned how to denoise an image and to blur people’s faces to hide their identities. 

  Then a neural network was used to detect the keypoints in all faces present in any photo. To do so I trained a CNN using Keras.

  In the first part I used Haar-Cascade to detect faces and eyes. This is a technique that consists of using a series of kernels in order to create a classifier that detects some object/feature. I used a pretrained classifier to detect faces.

  I also worked with Non-Local Means denoising to clean images. With this I was able to make the face detection step more robust. I also worked with canny edge detection to detect edges but I ended up not using it in the final pipeline.

  For the second part I created a simple CNN to detect the keypoints of any face.

  Finally I put everything together in order to have a program that was able to:

  * Extracts all faces from any image
  * Uses those faces as an input for a CNN that detects their’s keypoints
  * Uses those predictions and shows them back in the original image

  At the end I could use those keypoints to add some stickers to any photo.
