brief: The idea of this project was to use a Generative Adversial Network (GAN) to create new content.

  The faces generated looks enough realistic. The dataset used to train the network is big (it have around 200k images) so in order to reduce training times I cropped the images to 28 x 28 pixels. In the future I would like to train it without the cropping to see how the network performs.
