brief: |
  The aim of this project was to create a game agent to solve any diagonal sudoku.

  The sudoku is solved by using both elimination and constrain propagation. And we this is not enough the agent uses decision trees to explore different scenarios until it reaches a feasible solution.

  The AI created is able to solve any sudoku that have a solution. It can also solve sudokus that have more than one solution but it will only get one of them.
