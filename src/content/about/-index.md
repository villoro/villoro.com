  content: |
    My name is Arnau Villoro and I am an engineer based on Barcelona.
    I love automating almost everything I can and I enjoy building things all by myself.
    I have an MS in Management and I am currently studying Artificial Intelligence.
    I am also working full time as an IT Consultant offering both managment and development services.
    When I am not with a computer I enjoy doing sports such as climbing and biking
