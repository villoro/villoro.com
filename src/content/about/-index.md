Hi there, I'm **Arnau Villoro**, an engineer based in Barcelona who's passionate about making things run smoothly.
I thrive on automation â€“ it's like a puzzle to me, finding ways to streamline processes and build efficient solutions from scratch.

With a background in **Industrial Engineering**, I've delved into the world of data engineering.
From crunching numbers as a Data Analyst to leading teams as a Data Engineering Manager and diving deep into algorithms as a Machine Learning Engineer, I've worn many hats in the data realm.

As a dedicated **Data Engineer**, I'm all about transforming raw data into actionable insights.
I specialize in designing, developing, and deploying robust data infrastructure to help businesses thrive in the digital age.

When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll likely find me **scaling cliffs** or enjoying a good book in the sun.
I also enjoy **tinkering with electrical installations**, combining my technical skills with hands-on projects.
Balancing my love for tech with outdoor adventures and DIY projects keeps me grounded and ready to tackle any challenge head-on.
