## 1. What is pre-commit

With pre-commit you can automate some repetitive tasks before doing a `commit` on a **git** repository.
It is useful for identifying simple issues before submission to code review.

For example with **pre-commit** you can point out issues in code such as missing semicolons, trailing whitespace, and debug statements.

**Pre-commit** can work with **any development language** even though is a python package.

## 2. Installation

To install you can simply run:

```sh
pip install pre-commit
```

## 3. Configuration

Once you have the package installed you need the file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with the hooks you need.

As an example you can use:

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  .pre-commit-config.yaml
</TerminalOutput>
```yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v2.3.0
    hooks:
    -   id: check-yaml
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
-   repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 19.3b0
    hooks:
    -   id: black
```

Once you are in a repository that has the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file you can install the hooks with:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

## 4. Usage

By default `pre-commit` will run only on the stagged files. You can check all the files the first time you install it with:

```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```

After that each time you try to do a commit `pre-commit` will run all hooks and will prevent you from commiting simple issues.

## 5. Updating hooks

You can update all `pre-commit` hooks with:

```sh
pre-commit autoupdate
```

## 6. Continuous integration (CI)

It is a good idea to run `pre-commit` on your CI to check that nobody is pushing code with errors.

You can do it with:

```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```

If you want to only run it on the files that have changed just do:

```sh
pre-commit run --from-ref origin.HEAD --to-ref HEAD
```

## 7. Useful hooks

There are some default hooks defined <FancyLink linkText="Pre-commit hooks" url="https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks"/>.

Some that I find really useful are:

* check-merge-conflict
* check-json
* check-toml
* check-yaml
* no-commit-to-branch

You can add them with the following code:

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  .pre-commit-config.yaml
</TerminalOutput>
```yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v2.3.0
    hooks:
    -   id: check-merge-conflict
    -   id: check-json
    -   id: check-toml
    -   id: check-yaml
    -   id: no-commit-to-branch
```
