## 1. Regex basics

A regular expression, or **regex** for short, is a pattern describing a certain amount of text.
The most simple regex is a regular string, like `hello` which will match the literal text `hello`.

There are some characters with special meanings. For example `.` will match any character (except line break).
As an example `ip.d` will match `ipad`, `ipod`, `ip@d` etc.

If we want to only match `ipod` or `ipad` we can use `ip[ao]d`.

### 1.1. Brackets `[]`

Brackets (`[` and `]`) are used for specifying which characters are allowed. It is similar to an **or** operator. As an example:

* `[abc]`: `a`, `b` or `c`
* `[a-c]`: `a`, `b` or `c`
* `[^a-c]`: anything but `a`, `b` or `c`
* `[0-9a-fA-F]`: any number or any letter between `a` and `f` or between `A` and `F`. This represents hexadecimal

### 1.1. Position

It is possible to specify matches based on the position with:

* `^`: Start 
* `$`: End

For example `^ab` will only match the first `ab` in `ab abc ab` ([Demo](https://regex101.com/r/TJzoA7/2))

### 1.2. Classes

There are certain keywords that will match different types of characters.
For example `\d` will match any digit (any of those `0123456789`).
Those classes can be inversed with capital letters. As an example `\D` will match any character except a digit.

The main classes available are:

| regex | description                             | example                                      | inverse |
|-------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------|
| `\d`  | Digits                                  | [d_example](https://regex101.com/r/RM6mHO/1) | `\D`    |
| `\w`  | Alphanumeric and/or `_`                 | [w_example](https://regex101.com/r/IkIMMm/1) | `\W`    |
| `\s`  | Whitespaces and equivalents (like tabs) | [s_example](https://regex101.com/r/oSziKA/1) | `\S`    |

### 1.3. Quantifiers

It is possible to specify how many times a letter or group (defined in the next section) should appear.

As an example we want the letter `a` + the letter `b` which should appear different number of times:

| regex    | description                                     | example                                            |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `ab*`    | `a` + `b` zero times or more                    | [example_ab*](https://regex101.com/r/ob5aYo/1)     |
| `ab+`    | `a` + `b` one time or more                      | [example_ab+](https://regex101.com/r/b0o38q/1)     |
| `ab?`    | `a` + optional `b` (zero or one time)           | [example_ab?](https://regex101.com/r/S91Cbe/1)     |
| `ab{2}`  | `a` + `b` exactly 2 times                       | [example_ab{2}](https://regex101.com/r/TYBz4I/1)   |
| `ab{2,5}`| `a` + `b` between 2 and 5 times (inclusive)     | [example_ab{2,5}](https://regex101.com/r/b4oI9X/1) |

### 1.4. Groups

It is possible to define **groups** in regex.
They are use to capture part of the text and are declared with parenthesis `()`.
We can use any regex inside the group. For example if we want to math `hello`:

* `(hello)`: capturing group ([Demo](https://regex101.com/r/8W86e1/1)) 
* `(?:hello)`: non-capturing group
* `(?P<name>hello)`: same but giving the group a name (`name` in this case)
* `(hello|bye):` **or** operator in groups.

### 1.5. Boundaries

It is possible to declare a boundary with `\b` (with the inverse `\B`).
A boundary means that is surrounded with a non word type character.
It is similar to the **start** (`^`) and **end** (`$`).

It is easier to understand it with some examples:

| regex          | text: `Impossible to do`                                       | text: `I'm possible :)`                                       | text: `possibler`                                       | example                                         |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `possible`     | Im<span style="background-color:aquamarine;">possible</span> to do | I'm <span style="background-color:aquamarine;">possible</span> :) | <span style="background-color:aquamarine;">possible</span>r | [boundaries_1](https://regex101.com/r/Ygl8wW/1) |
| `\bpossible`   | Impossible to do                                               | I'm <span style="background-color:aquamarine;">possible</span> :) | <span style="background-color:aquamarine;">possible</span>r | [boundaries_2](https://regex101.com/r/WT2kd5/1) |
| `\bpossible\b` | Impossible to do                                               | I'm <span style="background-color:aquamarine;">possible</span> :) | possibler                                               | [boundaries_3](https://regex101.com/r/2qDt77/1) |
| `possible\B`   | Impossible to do                                               | I'm possible :)                                               | <span style="background-color:aquamarine;">possible</span>r | [boundaries_4](https://regex101.com/r/jL4Lkv/1) |
| `\Bpossible`   | Im<span style="background-color:aquamarine;">possible</span> to do | I'm possible :)                                               | possibler                                               | [boundaries_5](https://regex101.com/r/bnTUnx/1) |

### 1.6. Flags

It is possible to change the behaviour of the regex with some flags:

* `(?i)`: **case insensitive**. For example `(?i)hello` will match `HELLO` ([demo](https://regex101.com/r/jr3Zrq/1))
* `(?m)`: **multi line**. When this is active the anchor `^` will be start of line instead of start of text ([demo](https://regex101.com/r/Ol3N99/1))
* `(?s)`: **single line**.

### 1.7. Greedy vs lazy

Imagine that we have the following text:

```html
<h1> Title </h1>
<p> Hello </p>
```

If we want to capture the start of an html tag (`<h1>` and `<p>` in this case) one might be tempted to use something like `<\w+>`.
However that will match the whole line (for both lines) since we are specifying `<` followed by any text and ended with `>` ([demo](https://regex101.com/r/ZoRRT1/1)).
If we want to stop it at the first appearence of `>` we can use the non greedy regex `<.+?>` ([demo](https://regex101.com/r/j2OnQv/1)).

Some better alternatives are `<\w+>` or `<[^<>]+>`.

To sum up:

* `<.+>`: greedy
* `<.+?>`: non greedy

<Notice type="info">
  It can also be used with other quantifiers that are not the `+`.
</Notice>


## 2. Regex with python

### 2.1. `re` package

To use regex in **python** you first need to import the `re` package with

```sh
import re
```

Then to check if there is a match in a text with one regex using `out = re.match(regex, text)`:

```python
out = re.match(r"hello", "hello world")

# out is a class if we only want to know if there is a match we can use `bool(out)`
```

<Notice type="info" className="mt-6">
  When declaring regexs in python it is a good practise to declare them as **raw** strings with `r"regex"`
</Notice>

### 2.2. `match` vs `search`

We have use `re.match` since it's faster. However this only looks at the begining of the string.
To do a more in deep search we can use `re.search`.

Let's compare them by doing checking different regexs against the following text:

```python
text = """hello world
bye world"""
```

The results would be:

| regex      | re.match | re.search |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| `r"hello"` | ✔️       | ✔️       |
| `r"world"` | ❌       | ✔️       |
| `r"bye"`   | ❌       | ✔️       |

### 2.3. `re.compile`

If we plan to reuse the same regex we can compile it with `regex = re.compile(regex)`:

```python
regex = re.compile(r"hello")
```

And then we can use both `match` and/or `search` with:

```python
regex.match("hello world")

regex.search("hello world")
```

The advantage is that a **compiled regex is faster** than a non-compiled one.

### 2.4. Working with groups

Imagine that we have the following file names:

```python
filenames = [
    "Informe mensual Indexa Capital - AABBCCDD - 2020-01.pdf",
    "Informe mensual Indexa Capital - XXYYZZWW - 2020-01.pdf",
    "Informe mensual Indexa Capital - AABBCCDD - 2021-03.pdf",
    "Informe mensual Indexa Capital - XXYYZZWW - 2020-12.pdf",
]
```

#### 2.4.1. Unnamed groups

It looks more or less clear that we can extract some data from those names:

```python
regex = re.compile(r"Informe mensual Indexa Capital - (\w{8}) - (\d{4})-(\d{2}).pdf")

out = regex.match(filenames[0])
out.groups()
```
<TerminalOutput>
  \> ('AABBCCDD', '2020', '01')
</TerminalOutput>

#### 2.4.2. Named groups

We can use named groups to better extract the data

```python
regex = re.compile(r"Informe mensual Indexa Capital - (?P<account>\w{8}) - (?P<year>\d{4})-(?P<month>\d{2}).pdf")

out = regex.match(filenames[1])
out.groupdict()
```
<TerminalOutput>
  \> `{'account': 'XXYYZZWW', 'year': '2020', 'month': '01'}`
</TerminalOutput>

Clearly we can use that to rename the files doing something like:

```python
out_pattern = "{year}_{month} Indexa capital {account}.pdf"

for filename in filenames:
    groups = regex.match(filename).groupdict()
    new_name = out_pattern.format(**groups)
  
    print(new_name)
```
<TerminalOutput>
  2020_01 Indexa capital AABBCCDD.pdf
  2020_01 Indexa capital XXYYZZWW.pdf
  2021_03 Indexa capital AABBCCDD.pdf
  2020_12 Indexa capital XXYYZZWW.pdf
</TerminalOutput>


## 3. Regex with pandas

There are multiple functions in **pandas** that can be used with **regex**. They are:

1. `count`: count occurrences that match a regex
2. `replace`: replace based on a regex
3. `match`: same as `re.match`
4. `contains`: same as `re.search`
5. `findall`: same as `re.findall`
6. `split` / `rsplit`: splits text based on a regex
7. `extract`: extract groups using a regex

In order to explain them let's create a really dummy dataframe with:

```python
import pandas as pd

queries = [
    "select *  FROM  users",
    "SELECT count(id) AS cnt FROM public.users",
    "SELECT * FROM orders",
    "SELECT city, count(1) FROM orders GROUP BY 1",
]
df = pd.DataFrame(queries, columns=["query"])
```

### 3.1. `series.str.count`

In this case we want to `count` the number of queries that come from the `users` table.
It doesn't matter if the schema is specified or not. It can be done with:

```python
df["query"].str.count(r"\s+FROM\s+(\w+\.)?users\b")
```
<TerminalOutput>
  1
  1
  0
  0
</TerminalOutput>

### 3.2. `series.str.replace`

We can use this for deleting the renamings (like ` AS cnt`):

```python
df["query"].str.replace(r"\s+AS\s+\w+\b", "", regex=True)
```
<TerminalOutput>
  `select *  FROM  users`
  `SELECT count(id) FROM public.users`
  `SELECT * FROM orders`
  `SELECT city, count(1) FROM orders GROUP BY 1`
</TerminalOutput>

### 3.3. `series.str.match`

In this case we can look which queries are selecting all columns (`SELECT * FROM`):

```python
df["query"].str.match(r"(?i)(SELECT)\s+\*\s+(?i)(FROM)")
```
<TerminalOutput>
  True
  False
  True
  False
</TerminalOutput>

### 3.4. `series.str.contains`

Similar to the `replace` example, let's get the queries that have a rename `AS x`:

```python
df["query"].str.contains(r"\s+AS\s+\w+")
```
<TerminalOutput>
  False
  True
  False
  False
</TerminalOutput>

### 3.5. `series.str.findall`

We can use this for getting a list with all words that have between 5 and 8 letters:

```python
df["query"].str.findall(r"\w{5,8}")
```
<TerminalOutput>
  [`select`, `users`]
  [`SELECT`, `count`, `public`, `users`]
  [`SELECT`, `orders`]
  [`SELECT`, `count`, `orders`, `GROUP`]
</TerminalOutput> 

<Notice type="info">
  Note that the output is one list per row.
</Notice>

### 3.6. `series.str.split` / `series.str.rsplit`

In this case let's split the query in 2 parts, all before the `FROM` and all after it:

```python
df["query"].str.split(r"\s+(?i)from\s+")
```
<TerminalOutput>
  [`select *`, `users`]
  [`SELECT count(id) AS cnt`, `public.users`]
  [`SELECT *`, `orders`]
  [`SELECT city, count(1)`, `orders GROUP BY 1`]
</TerminalOutput> 

### 3.7. `series.str.extract`

With this function we can extract data from groups.
The output of this function is a **DataFrame** where each group is a column.

```python
regex = r"(?i)SELECT\s+(?:.+)\s+(?i)FROM\s+(?P<schema>\w+\.)?(?P<table>\w+)\b"
df["query"].str.extract(regex)
```

The output in this case is:

| schema    | table  |
|-----------|--------|
| Nan       | users  |
| public.   | users  |
| Nan       | orders |
| Nan       | orders |

The regex used in this example might be a little bit complex, let's analyze it by parts:

* `(?i)SELECT`: `SELECT` statement case insensitive
* `\s+`: one or more spaces
* `(?:.+)`: any number of characters in a non-capturing group (so that it does not appear as column in the output)
* `\s+`: one or more spaces
* `(?i)FROM`: `FROM` statement case insensitive
* `\s+`: one or more spaces
* `(?:(?P<schema>\w+)\.)?`: Optional non-capturing group composed with:
    * `(?P<schema>\w+)`: Capturing group named `schema` made only with words
    * `\.`: a dot (`.`)
* `(?P<table>\w+)\b`: Capturing group named `table` made only with words and that has a right boundary


## 4. Regex with redshift

In **redshift** there are 4 string functions that work with regular expressions (regex).
They are:

| Function                                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [REGEXP_COUNT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/REGEXP_COUNT.html)     | Returns an integer that indicates the number of times the pattern occurs in the string. If no match is found, then the function returns 0.               |
| [REGEXP_INSTR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/REGEXP_INSTR.html)     | Returns an integer that indicates the beginning position or ending position of the matched substring. If no match is found, then the function returns 0. |
| [REGEXP_REPLACE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/REGEXP_REPLACE.html) | Replaces every occurrence of the pattern with the specified string.                                                                                      |
| [REGEXP_SUBSTR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/REGEXP_SUBSTR.html)   | Returns the characters extracted from a string by searching for a regular expression pattern.                                                            |


There is also the `SIMILAR` operator for using **regexs** inside `WHERE` statements. For example:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM event WHERE name SIMILAR TO '%(Ring|Die)%';

-- It is the same as:
SELECT count(*) FROM event where name LIKE '%Ring%' OR name LIKE '%Die%';
```
