## 0. Motivation

Last year, I bought a <FancyLink linkText="Geekom AS6" url="https://www.geekompc.com/geekom-as-6-mini-pc/"/> and I'm really happy with it.
It has an integrated GPU (680M) that allows me to play most modern games at 1080p, such as Resident Evil 4 Remake.
I bought it since it's almost identical to the <FancyLink linkText="Asus PN53" url="https://www.asus.com/displays-desktops/mini-pcs/pn-series/asus-expertcenter-pn53/"/> and that gave me the confidence to buy from what was an unknown brand at the time.

It has been working really well until summer arrived.
Due to high temperatures, the CPU was shutting down because of excessive heat.

## 1. What's the problem

I have been using <FancyLink linkText="Open Hardware Monitor" url="https://openhardwaremonitor.org/"/> to track and store multiple data from the computer, such as temperatures, load, and power consumption.

My computer has a <FancyLink linkText="Ryzen 7 6800H" url="https://www.amd.com/en/product/11546"/> processor, which has a default TDP of 45W but can be set between 35W to 54W. The **max temperature is 95ºC**.

The problem I had is that under high load in summer, temperatures were too high:

<canvas id="stats_without_limits" style="width:100%;height:300px;"></canvas>

<Notice type="danger">
  The CPU was around 97 ºC, which is higher than the max 95 ºC.
  Whenever it reached 100 ºC, the computer automatically turned off to prevent damage.
</Notice>

<Notice type="info">
  The CPU load looks low because I was gaming at the time (GPU intensive).
  GPU load is not tracked nor included in the CPU load, which is why it looks like the computer was close to idle.
</Notice>

## 2. Regular ways to prevent overheating

Here are the most common ways to prevent overheating.

### 2.1. Changing TDP on the BIOS

Many computers allow you to lower the Thermal Design Power (TDP) to reduce the CPU's wattage, helping to prevent overheating.

However, some PCs (such as mine) do not have this option.

### 2.2. Undervolting

Another method is undervolting the CPU with a tool like <FancyLink linkText="MSI Afterburner" url="https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards"/>. It doesn't work for all computers and can be dangerous.

<Notice type="warning">
  Undervolting can permanently damage your computer, proceed with caution.
</Notice>

### 2.3. Dedicated software

Some PCs have dedicated software.
For example, for AMD, there is <FancyLink linkText="AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition™ Application" url="https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adrenalin.html"/> and <FancyLink linkText="AMD Ryzen™ Master Utility for Overclocking Control" url="https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/ryzen-master.html"/>.
However, I couldn't change the TDP on my computer with either of these tools.

## 3. Using RyzenAdj

After having no luck with the previous methods, I discovered <FancyLink linkText="RyzenAdj" url="https://github.com/FlyGoat/RyzenAdj" dark="true"/>, which allows you to configure multiple settings for your AMD Ryzen CPU.

### 3.1. Check current setup

First, download RyzenAdj to a folder (like `C:\AMD`).
Then, check the current setup with:

```sh
ryzenadj.exe -i
```
<Notice type="warning">
  Must be run as an Administrator.

You will see information like this:

### 3.2. What to change with RyzenAdj

There are multiple ways to prevent overheating. In my case, I want to change:

* **STAPM Limit** (`--stapm-limit=40000`): Manages the long-term average power consumption of the CPU based on thermal conditions to prevent overheating and ensure thermal comfort.
* **Fast Limit** (`--fast-limit=45000`): Controls the maximum power the CPU can draw during short bursts of high performance, allowing the CPU to handle intensive tasks more efficiently.
* **Slow Limit** (`--slow-limit=40000`): Sets the maximum sustained power the CPU can draw over longer periods, ensuring that the CPU does not overheat during prolonged use and maintains system stability.
* **Thermal Control Temperature** (`--tctl-temp=90`): Sets the maximum allowable temperature for the CPU cores to prevent the CPU from reaching high temperatures, reducing thermal throttling, prolonging the lifespan of the CPU, and ensuring the system remains cool and stable.

After tracking temperatures and CPU usage, I settled for:

| Name     | Limit | Parameter   |
|----------|------:|-------------|
| STAPM    |  40.0 | stapm-limit |
| PPT FAST |  45.0 | fast-limit  |
| PPT SLOW |  40.0 | slow-limit  |
| THM CORE |  90.0 | tctl-temp   |

### 3.3. Limit TDP and Temperature

To apply the changes, simply run:

```sh
ryzenadj.exe --stapm-limit=40000 --fast-limit=45000 --slow-limit=40000 --tctl-temp=90 -i
```

Then validate that the limits are properly set up:

| Name     | Value | Limit                                                 | Parameter   |
|----------|------:|------------------------------------------------------:|-------------|
| STAPM    |   8.0 | <span style="background-color:PaleGreen;">40.0</span> | stapm-limit |
| PPT FAST |  14.8 | <span style="background-color:PaleGreen;">45.0</span> | fast-limit  |
| PPT SLOW |   8.3 | <span style="background-color:PaleGreen;">40.0</span> | slow-limit  |
| THM CORE |  53.0 | <span style="background-color:PaleGreen;">90.0</span> | tctl-temp   |

## 4. Stress testing

Once you have changed the limits, you should test that your computer does not overheat.
You can do this with <FancyLink linkText="3D Mark" url="https://benchmarks.ul.com/3dmark" company="default" dark="true"/> or <FancyLink linkText="AIDA64" url="https://www.aida64.com/downloads" company="default" dark="true"/> (among others).
To ensure your computer doesn't overheat, I suggest running a CPU and GPU test simultaneously.

Here are my results:

<canvas id="stats_with_limits" style="width:100%;height:300px;"></canvas>

<Notice type="success">
  You can see that the TDP remains at 40 W and that the temperature never reaches the danger zone (above 95 ºC).
</Notice>

## 5. Limit TDP at start up

Unfortunately, the changes made by `ryzenadj.exe` will only work for the current session.
Once you restart your PC, you will need to apply them again.

### 5.1. Create Scheduled Task

To automatically apply them at start up, you can create a `Scheduled Task`.

To do so:

1. Open Task Scheduler:
    * Press `Win + S` and type `Task Scheduler`, then press Enter.
2. Create a New Task:
    * In the Task Scheduler window, click on `Create Task` in the right-hand pane.
3. General Tab:
    * Name your task (e.g., `Set AMD TDP Limits`).
    * Under `Security options`, select `Run whether user is logged on or not`.
    * Check `Run with highest privileges`.
4. Triggers Tab:
    * Click `New...` to create a new trigger.
    * Choose `At startup` from the `Begin the task` dropdown.
    * Click OK.
5. Actions Tab:
    * Click `New...` to create a new action.
    * For `Action`, select `Start a program`.
    * In the `Program/script` field, enter the path to ryzenadj.exe. If it's not in a standard location, you might need to use the full path.
    * In the `Add arguments (optional)` field, enter the arguments for the command: `--stapm-limit=40000 --fast-limit=45000 --slow-limit=40000  --tctl-temp=90`
    * Click `OK`.
6. Conditions Tab:
    * Adjust any conditions if necessary, but it's usually fine to leave them as default.
7. Settings Tab:
    * Ensure `Allow task to be run on demand` is checked.
    * Optionally, you can adjust other settings to suit your needs.
8. Save the Task:
    * Click `OK`.
    * You may be prompted to enter your administrator password to create the task.

### 5.2. Verify Scheduled Task

To ensure the task works correctly, restart your computer and validate that the limits are correctly applied with:

```sh
ryzenadj.exe -i
```

If you encounter any issues, you can manually run the task:

1. Go back to the Task Scheduler and find your newly created task.
2. Right-click the task and select "Run" to test if it works as expected.
3. Ensure that the TDP limits are applied correctly.
