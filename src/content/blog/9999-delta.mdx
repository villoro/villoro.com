## 1. Why Delta Lake?
- Issues with raw Parquet and Hive tables
- Comparison with Iceberg and Hudi

## 2. Core Concepts
- Delta log (_delta_log) and checkpoint Parquet files
- Table protocol versions and feature flags
- Data files vs. transaction log entries
- Partitioning, statistics, and data skipping

## 3. Inner Workings
### 3.1 Transaction log structure (JSON + checkpoints)
### 3.2 Commit protocol and optimistic concurrency
### 3.3 Vacuum/retention model and tombstones
### 3.4 Change Data Feed (CDF) internals
### 3.5 Schema enforcement and evolution rules
### 3.6 Deletion vectors and row-level operations

## 4. Features
- ACID transactions and schema enforcement
- Time travel by version or timestamp
- MERGE INTO, UPDATE, DELETE semantics
- Z-Ordering and clustering strategies
- Change Data Feed (CDF) for incremental pipelines
- Unity Catalog integration

## 5. How to Query & Interact
- Spark SQL/DataFrame API (primary interface)
- Delta-RS / delta-kernel for Trino, DuckDB, Presto
- Delta in query engines (Databricks SQL, Athena via connectors)
- Python support (delta-spark basics)

## 6. Maintenance & Operations
- OPTIMIZE (bin-packing) and Z-ORDER (clustering)
- VACUUM and retention settings (risks and safety)
- Managing small files
- Schema changes (mergeSchema, overwriteSchema)
- Performance tuning (data skipping, checkpoint intervals)
- Observability (DESCRIBE HISTORY, logs, metrics)

## 7. Pitfalls & Best Practices
- Safe VACUUM (retention periods, external readers)
- Choosing when/how to Z-ORDER
- Concurrency hotspots in MERGE workloads
- Protocol upgrades and compatibility

## 8. Reference Architecture & Examples
- Typical stack (S3/ADLS + Spark/Databricks + Delta)
- Example SQL for MERGE, DELETE, UPDATE, time travel
- Incremental ETL with CDF

## 9. When to Choose Delta Lake
- Spark/Databricks-first teams
- Heavy MERGE workloads and CDF needs
- Built-in maintenance ops (OPTIMIZE/Z-ORDER)
