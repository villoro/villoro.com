  ## 0. Why SQL with python?

  SQL is one of the most relevant language for databases. So at one point you will need to interact to get, store or modify some data. Fortunatelly you can do it in python using **SQL Alchemy**.

  In this post I will show to do it while giving some advices based on problems I had.

  ## 1. Connect to a SQL database

  In order to connect to a SQL database you will need to create an engine. The best way is to use the functions `create_engine` and `engine.url.URL`. For example:

  ```python
  import pandas as pd # Used later to read/insert data
  import sqlalchemy as sa

  engine = sa.create_engine(
      sa.engine.url.URL(
          drivername=drivername,
          username="root",
          password="1234",
          host="localhost",
          port=port,
          database="db",
      ),
  )
  ```

  You obviously will need to use your credentials for `username`, `password`, `host` and `database`.

  For the `drivername` and `port` below you have and example for some popular SQL databases:

  ```yaml
  postgres:
    drivername: "postgresql"
    port: 5439

  redshift:
    drivername: "redshift+psycopg2"
    port: 5432

  my_sql:
    drivername: "mysql+pymysql"
    port: 3306
  ```

  More info about SQL engines at [SQL Alchemy documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html).

  ## 2. Read data from SQL

  To retrive a pandas dataframe it is easy. You can directly use pandas `read_sql_query` function:

  ```python
  with engine.connect() as connection:
      df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM my_table", connection)
  ```

  ## 3. Run a SQL sentence

  You can also run an `UPDATE`, `DELETE` or other SQL sentences by creating a connection with the engine as follows:

  ```python
  with engine.connect() as connection:
      connection.execute("DELETE FROM my_table WHERE id > 10")
  ```

  ## 4. Run stored procedures

  It is also posible to run stored procedures and to pass parameters to it. To do so you need to access the raw connection of the engine.

  ```python
  with engine.raw_connection().cursor() as cursor:
      cursor.execute("my_stored_procedure ?, ?", ['param_1', 'param_2'])
      cursor.commit()
  ```

  If you don't have input parameters you can run `cursor.execute("my_stored_procedure")`.

  ## 5. Insert data to SQL

  Ideally to insert data to SQL is as easy as calling the datafram function `to_sql`. For example:

  ```python
  df.to_sql(name="my_table", con=engine, if_exists="append", index=False)
  ```

  > Be careful with using `if_exists="replace"` because it will delete the SQL table an create it another time. This caused me some problems when I was inserting japanese text in a table because the encoding was lost in the process.

  > I usually use `index=False` because the index will be a dummy one. If it is not the case first call `df.reset_index()`.


  ### 5.1. Inserting data to PostgreSQL
  The function `df.to_sql` works well with `MySQL` but I had serious performance problems when working with `PostgreSQL`. Luckily there is a workaround:

  ```
  from io import StringIO

  output = StringIO()
  df.to_csv(output, sep=';', header=False, index=False, columns=df.columns)
  output.getvalue()
  # jump to start of stream
  output.seek(0)

  # Insert df into postgre
  connection = engine.raw_connection()
  with connection.cursor() as cursor:
      cursor.copy_from(output, "my_table", sep=';', null="NULL", columns=(df.columns))
      connection.commit()
  ```

  It is not as simple as before but I got a **10x** improvement.

  > Be careful to use the same separator in `df.to_csv` and `cursor.copy_from`
