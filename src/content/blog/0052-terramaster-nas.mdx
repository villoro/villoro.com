## 0. Motivation

After purchasing the <FancyLink linkText="Terramaster F2-424" url="https://amzn.to/40CRZqJ" company="amazon"/> NAS, I decided to document my setup process. This guide serves as both a personal reference in case I need to reinstall and a practical guide for others who might be setting up a similar NAS configuration.

## 1. About the hardware

For anyone considering a NAS, here’s a summary of my experience and the choices I made for my setup.

### 1.1. The NAS

Previously, I had a Synology D115J, but its CPU wasn’t quite powerful enough for my needs. I wanted a NAS capable of running multiple Docker containers, which required a more robust processor. After researching Synology and QNAP models, I found that their budget options were often limited by outdated CPUs.

That’s when I came across the Terramaster NAS lineup. Although I initially had reservations about Terramaster's Operating System (TOS), reviews suggested that it was straightforward to replace TOS with options like Unraid or TrueNAS if needed. Ultimately, I decided on a 2-bay NAS for simplicity, choosing fewer but larger disks for storage capacity. The <FancyLink linkText="Terramaster F2-424" url="https://amzn.to/40CRZqJ" company="amazon"/> offered the best balance of power and flexibility for my setup.

### 1.2. The Hard Drives

When selecting drives, I prioritized models rated for 24/7 operation, essential for NAS use. Initially, I purchased <FancyLink linkText="Seagate Exos X18 3.5 16TB" url="https://amzn.to/3O2h2vX" company="amazon"/> drives because they were cost-effective. However, the noise level turned out to be too disruptive, especially with the NAS housed in a cabinet near my living room. Fortunately, I was able to exchange them for <FancyLink linkText="Seagate IronWolf Pro 3.5 NAS 16TB" url="https://amzn.to/4eopD6G" company="amazon"/> drives (at an additional 90€ per drive). Although pricier, the IronWolf Pro drives are significantly quieter and better suited to my setup.

### 1.3. The SSDs

To keep my NAS as silent as possible, I added the <FancyLink linkText="WD Red SN700 1TB NVMe SSD" url="https://amzn.to/42rH5Vj" company="amazon" />.
It's a NAS-grade SSD rated at 2000 TBW — a high endurance rating that should ensure a long lifespan.

<Notice type="info">
  My goal was to install TOS on the SSD, allowing the HDDs to go into sleep mode when not in use — reducing both wear and noise.
</Notice>

### 1.4. The UPS

To protect the NAS from potential power outages, I opted for a UPS with a USB connection, enabling automatic shutdown of the NAS during an outage. I chose the <FancyLink linkText="Master Power (UPS 650 VA - 360W)" url="https://amzn.to/3YDj7Dw" company="amazon"/> as a budget-friendly option, which is ideal for low-power devices like my NAS. This UPS provides just enough backup power to safely handle brief outages and help prevent data loss.

## 2. Initial Setup

For a detailed installation guide, you may want to consult the <FancyLink linkText="Terramaster Quickguide" url="https://support.terra-master.com/quickguide/" company="terramaster"/>. Here, I’ll highlight the steps that were most relevant for my setup.

### 2.1. Locating the NAS

To begin, you’ll need to locate the NAS on your network. With a Terramaster NAS, simply navigate to <FancyLink linkText="tnas.local" url="http://tnas.local" dark="true" company="default"/>. After a few clicks, you should see the NAS IP displayed. If that doesn’t work, you can use a network analysis app, such as <FancyLink linkText="Fing" url="https://www.fing.com"/>, to find the NAS IP.

### 2.2. Install Terramaster OS (TOS)

To install TOS on the SSD:

1. Choose a **custom configuration** during the setup process.
2. Select all the SSDs you want to use for the installation.
3. Proceed with the **Online Install** option.

This process will partition each selected SSD to install the OS. While the installation completes, it’s a good time to review your network setup for optimal connectivity.

<Notice type="info">
  I decided to install TOS only on the main SSD and then use the secondary SSD (not a NAS SSD) as cache.
</Notice>

## 3. Network Configuration

Many users opt to use a secondary router rather than the one provided by their Internet Service Provider (ISP). ISP-provided routers often have limited features and performance. However, adding a secondary router can introduce double NAT, which can cause connectivity issues. You can learn more about double NAT and its effects in this <FancyLink linkText="guide" url="https://medium.com/@gmanual/double-nat-explained-and-possible-solutions-8b41b6c651bd" dark="true"/>.

To resolve double NAT, you have two main options:
1. Set the ISP router to **bridge mode**.
2. **Create a DMZ** on the ISP router for the secondary router.

Since I couldn’t enable bridge mode on my ISP router, I opted for the DMZ setup. Below are the steps that worked for me.

<Notice type="warning">
  Note: These steps may vary depending on your router models and network configuration. Refer to your router’s manual for model-specific instructions.
</Notice>

### 3.1. Reserve an IP for you secondary router

To set up a DMZ, the first step is to assign a static IP to your secondary router:

1. Locate the **MAC address** of your secondary router.
2. Access your **ISP router’s configuration** page.
2. In the DHCP settings, **create a DHCP binding** for the secondary router, preferably using its current IP for simplicity.

### 3.2. DMZ

Once the IP is reserved, follow these steps to set up the DMZ:

1. Go to the **ISP router’s configuration** page.
2. Locate the **DMZ settings**.
3. Enable the DMZ and assign it to the static IP of your secondary router.

## 4. Handling storage

Once TOS installation is complete, you can create your superuser account. Afterward, you’re ready to configure storage on the NAS.

<Notice type="warning">
  You can use letters, numbers, and special characters in your passwords, with a maximum length of 64 characters.
</Notice>

### 4.1. Creating a storage pool

<Notice type="warning">
  You might want to first create the storage pool for the SSDs and install the apps.
  Once done, then create the storage pool for the HDs. This will help reducing noise.
</Notice>

The first step is to choose a RAID configuration. Here are some general recommendations:
* **TRAID**: Suitable if you have disks of different sizes, as it minimizes wasted space. It’s also beneficial if you plan to add more disks in the future since TRAID doesn’t require volume recreation.
* **Standard RAID (0, 1, 5, or 6)**: Ideal if you have disks of the same size and don’t plan on adding more disks. Standard RAID setups are compatible with other operating systems and can be easier to recover in case of failures.

For storage formats, you can choose between `EXT4` and `BTRFS`. While both have advantages, I opted for `EXT4`, as it is often regarded as more stable. For a more detailed comparison, refer to <FancyLink linkText="BTRFS vs EXT4 | Terramaster forum" url="https://forum.terra-master.com/en/viewtopic.php?t=1851#:~:text=Re%3A%20BTRFS%20vs%20EXT4,-Post%20by%20TMzethar&text=The%20ext4%20format%20will%20retain,stable%20in%20terms%20of%20stability" company="terramaster"/>.

<Notice type="info">
  HDDs will be noisy during storage pool creation (RAID synchronization). Noise will decrease once synchronization completes and during regular usage.
</Notice>

### 4.2. Hyper Cache

You can use one of the two M.2 SSD slots for caching. This can enhance `read`, `write`, or `balanced` performance, depending on your NAS’s primary tasks.

### 4.3. SMD and connecting externally

There are different ways to connect to the NAS. My preferred method is mapping a network drive. To do this, you need to enable SMB:

1. Open the `Control Panel`.
2. Go to `Network Services > File Service`.
3. Under the `SMB` tab, enable it (you can keep the default settings).

### 4.4. Options for adding data

The NAS model I chose has two 2.5 Gbps Ethernet ports, which typically support file transfer speeds around 250–280 MB/s. Alternatively, you can use USB 3.1 Gen 1 with an external SSD, potentially achieving speeds between 300–400 MB/s. However, the Ethernet option is generally more efficient, as using an external SSD requires first copying data to the SSD, then transferring it to the NAS.

Note that your transfer speeds may be limited by the RAID configuration and the specific hard drives in use. For example, with the Seagate IronWolf Pro HDDs I installed, speeds top out at around 250 MB/s due to HDD limitations.

<Notice type="info">
  For optimal performance, I recommend transferring data over Ethernet rather than using an external USB drive.
</Notice>

## 5. Connecting locally (SSH)

When setting up applications, it can be very useful to access the NAS via a terminal (`ssh`), allowing direct command-line interaction.

<Notice type="danger">
  Only enable SSH if you are comfortable using it and aware of the security implications.
</Notice>

To enable SSH on your NAS:

1. Open the `Control Panel`.
1. Go to `Network Services` and select `Terminal & SNMP`.
2. Enable SSH access with your username and password.
3. For security, set a custom SSH port (default is `9222`).

After enabling SSH, you can connect to the NAS from a terminal with:

```sh
ssh [username]@[ip] -p [port]
```

Replace:
* `[username]` with the first user you created.
* `[ip]` with your NAS IP address.
* `[port]` with the SSH port you specified.

<Notice type="warning">
  To minimize security risks, disable `SSH` once setup is complete and you no longer need terminal access.
</Notice>

## 6. Installing Apps

The  `App Center` on your TerraMaster NAS allows you to install applications from both the official `Terramaster` repository and the `Community` repository.

For my setup, I installed:
* **Plex** for media streaming.
* **qBittorrent** for torrent management
* **Docker** (including `Docker Engine`, `Docker Manager` and `Portainer`)
* **Tailscale** (community app) for secure remote access

### 6.1. Plex

Plex setup is simple:

1. Open the app and sign in to your Plex account.
2. Create your libraries as desired.

For easier access, I recommend creating the Plex libraries within the `Public` folder.

<Notice type="warning">
  You might have problems claiming the server if you are accessing the NAS over tailscale.
  To set it up, **use the NAS IP** instead.
</Notice>

### 6.2. qBittorrent

Upon installing qBittorrent, an `admin` user is created with the password `adminadmin`.

<Notice type="info">
  If you used the community app, a random password may be generated. Check the logs for this information.
</Notice>

<Notice type="warning">
  For security, change the default password immediately: go to `Tools/Options/Web UI/Authentication`.
</Notice>

Suggested Download Configuration:

1. Save downloads in a shared location like (`/Volume1/public/Downloads`) for easy access.
2. Set up a monitored folder:
  * Monitored folder: `/Volume1/public/Torrents/`
  * Added `.torrent` files: `/Volume1/public/Torrents/Added/`
  * Completed downloads: `/Volume1/public/Torrents/Downloaded/`

This setup keeps everything organized and makes it easy to monitor new and completed downloads.

### 6.3. Tailscale

Tailscale, a community app, enables secure remote connections. Download it from the <FancyLink linkText="Tailscale | TerraMaster Community Place" url="https://tmnascommunity.eu/download/tailscale/" dark="true" company="default"/>and install it manually via `App Center/Settings/Install application manually`.

Connecting the NAS to Tailscale:

1. After installation, find the login URL in the log file (`/<your_user>/MOD_CONFIG/Tailscale/Tailscale_start.log`). It will look like:

```plaintext
To authenticate, visit:

  https://login.tailscale.com/a/xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

2. Visit this URL to register the NAS with your Tailscale account. Once added, it will appear in your Tailscale admin console (optionally, rename it to nas for easy identification).

#### 6.3.1. Set the NAS as an Exit Node

Optionally, you can configure the NAS as an exit node:

1. SSH into the NAS (use nas as the hostname if connected via Tailscale).

```sh
ssh [username]@nas -p [port]
```

2. Set the NAS as an exit node:

```sh
tailscale set --advertise-exit-node
```

3. To ensure the app remains updated, use:

```sh
tailscale set --auto-update
```

### 6.4. Docker and portainer

This is quite straighforward. The only important thing is that default Portainer credentials are:

* **user**: `admin`
* **password**: `admin`

Remeber to change them at the first login.

## 7. UPS Configuration

To safeguard against power outages, connecting the NAS to a UPS is highly recommended. Some UPS models offer USB connectivity, which allows the NAS to receive a shutdown signal during power interruptions.

To enable UPS support:

1. Go to `Control Panel/Hardware & Power`.
2. Check the `Enable USB Support` box.

This setup ensures your NAS can safely shut down in the event of a power failure, protecting your data and system.
