## 1. Why multiple environments exist

### 1.1 The traditional setup: dev, test, sandbox, prod

### 1.2 What problems they try to solve


## 2. The DBT perspective

### 2.1 How DBT handles environments

### 2.2 Switching targets with profiles

### 2.3 CI/CD workflows


## 3. One environment to rule them all

### 3.1 Running Python with only prod

### 3.2 Techniques: config flags, feature toggles, schema separation

### 3.3 Real-world patterns


## 4. Pros and cons

### 4.1 Advantages: simplicity, less drift, fewer surprises

### 4.2 Risks: less safe experimentation, higher blast radius

### 4.3 Mitigation strategies


## 5. Closing thoughts

### 5.1 When it makes sense to go prod-only

### 5.2 When you probably still want multiple environments
