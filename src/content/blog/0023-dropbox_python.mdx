  When developing with python people usually want to store some data.
  If this data is quite big and/or contains personal information it is not advised to store it in **github** (or other git providers).
  One good option is to store it in [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/).

  ## 1. Using dropbox with python
  Dropbox has a really nice package that you can install with

  ```
  pip install dropbox
  ```

  It is not really difficult to use it but I noticed that every time I wanted to I had to look for old code.
  So I decided that I could create a post that explained everything.

  The first thing to do is create an app inside **dropbox** since you cannot get a token without it.
  To do so go to [dropbox developers](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps).

  <div class="w3-center">
    <img src="/static/images/posts/dropbox_create_app.png" alt="dropbox_create_app" class="w3-image w3-padding-16 w3-border" style="max-height: 800px;"/>
  </div>

  Register a new app that will use **Dropbox API** and will acces only the **app folder**.
  Once you have create the app go to the app settings page and create a token.

  <div class="w3-center">
    <img src="/static/images/posts/dropbox_get_token.png" alt="dropbox_get_token" class="w3-image w3-padding-16 w3-border" style="max-height: 800px;"/>
  </div>

  You can now store that secret in a safe way (for example as an environment variable or a hidden file).

  ## 2. Working with BytesIO

  The key to write or read files is using `io.BytesIO` object.

  As an example you can create this object with:

  ```python
  txt = "Hello World"

  stream = io.BytesIO(txt.encode())
  stream.seek(0)

  # Here you do whatever you need

  stream.close()
  ```

  Or even better you can use the `with` statement so that you don't need to close the `stream`:

  ```python
  txt = "Hello World"

  with io.BytesIO(txt.encode()) as stream:
      stream.seek(0)

      # Here you do whatever you need
  ```

  > It is important to run `stream.seek(0)` to go to the begining of the stream.

  ## 3. Writting files to dropbox

  The first thing you need to do is to init the dropbox object with:

  ```python
  import io
  import dropbox

  DBX = dropbox.Dropbox(token)
  ```

  After creating the `DBX` instance you can upload files using `DBX.files_upload`.

  ### 3.1. Write a text file

  You will need to create the `io.BytesIO` object and upload it.

  ```python
  txt = "Hello World"

  with io.BytesIO(txt.encode()) as stream:
      stream.seek(0)

      # Write a text file
      DBX.files_upload(stream.read(), "/test.txt", mode=dropbox.files.WriteMode.overwrite)
  ``` 

  To allow overwriting you need to pass `mode=dropbox.files.WriteMode.overwrite` to the function `DBX.files_upload`.

  > **Important:** filenames should start with `/`. It won't work without it.

  ### 3.2. Write a json

  To write a dictionary-like file you can use the following:

  ```python
  import json

  data = {"a": 1, "b": "hey"}

  with io.StringIO() as stream:
      json.dump(data, stream, indent=4) # Ident param is optional

      stream.seek(0)

      DBX.files_upload(stream.read().encode(), "/test.json", mode=dropbox.files.WriteMode.overwrite)
  ```

  ### 3.3. Write a yaml

  It is very similar to writting a `json`:

  ```python
  import yaml

  data = {"a": 1, "b": "hey"}

  with io.StringIO() as stream:
      yaml.dump(data, stream, default_flow_style=False)

      stream.seek(0)

      DBX.files_upload(stream.read().encode(), "/test.yaml", mode=dropbox.files.WriteMode.overwrite)
  ```


  This time we are encoding the stream to transform it to bytes.

  ### 3.4. Write an Excel with Pandas

  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  df = pd.DataFrame([range(5), list("ABCDE")])

  with io.BytesIO() as stream:

      with pd.ExcelWriter(stream) as writer:
          df.to_excel(writer)
          writer.save()
      
      stream.seek(0)

      DBX.files_upload(stream.getvalue(), "/test.xlsx", mode=dropbox.files.WriteMode.overwrite)
  ```

  The key is to use the `ExcelWriter` from **pandas**.

  ### 3.5. Write a csv with Pandas

  Unfortunatelly it is not possible to dump a `csv` directly with **Pandas** into a `StringIO` at this time (More info: [here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/22555))

  However there is a workaround:

  ```python
  df = pd.DataFrame([range(5), list("ABCDE")])

  data = df.to_csv(index=False) # The index parameter is optional

  with io.BytesIO(data.encode()) as stream:
      stream.seek(0)

      DBX.files_upload(stream.read(), "/test.csv", mode=dropbox.files.WriteMode.overwrite)
  ```

  ## 4. Reading files

  To read a file you can use `DBX.files_download`.
  This will return some metadata as the first parameter and the result of the **API** call as the second.

  ### 4.1. Read a text file

  ```python
  _, res = DBX.files_download("/test.txt")

  res.raise_for_status()

  with io.BytesIO(res.content) as stream:
      txt = stream.read().decode()
  ```

  > Remember to decode the stream to transform it from bytes to string

  ### 4.2. Read a json

  ```python
  _, res = DBX.files_download("/test.json")

  with io.BytesIO(res.content) as stream:
      data = json.load(stream)
  ```

  ### 4.3. Read a yaml

  ```python
  _, res = DBX.files_download("/test.yaml")

  with io.BytesIO(res.content) as stream:
      data = yaml.safe_load(stream)
  ```

  > You should always use `yaml.safe_load` instead of `yaml.load`

  ### 4.4. Read an Excel with Pandas

  ```python
  _, res = DBX.files_download("/test.xlsx")

  with io.BytesIO(res.content) as stream:
      df = pd.read_excel(stream, index_col=0)
  ```

  > If you do not want a new dummy index use `index_col=0`.

  ### 4.5. Read a csv with Pandas

  ```python
  _, res = DBX.files_download("/test.csv")

  with io.BytesIO(res.content) as stream:
      df = pd.read_csv(stream, index_col=0)
  ```

  ## 5. Deleting files

  To delete a file simply call `DBX.files_delete(filename)`.

  ## 6. Working with other formats

  With this post you should have enough to work with **dropbox** using python.
  However, if you need to work another format look on how to create a `StringIO` object that represent this format.
