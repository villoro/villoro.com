## Introduction

Buying a home in Spain involves a long, structured process. This guide shares the full journey: timelines, bank interactions, how offers work, and the strategies that saved money during the mortgage. It also includes crucial details about taxes, refinancing, and lesser-known financing options to make this the most complete guide possible.

## 1. Timeline

### Pre-reservation (optional)

Find a house and give some money

### Pre-Approval (Viabilidad)

Banks or brokers request income documents (nóminas, IRPF, bank statements). Pre-approval normally takes a few days.

### Reservation (Contrato de Arras)

Once you choose a property, you sign arras and put down a deposit. This triggers the mortgage race.

### Shopping for Mortgages

Contact banks and brokers in parallel. Collect FEIN/FIAE offers. Typical cycle: 1–3 weeks.

### Appraisal (Tasación)

Required by all banks. Takes 3–7 days. If the appraisal is lower than the purchase price, the bank finances based on the appraisal value.

### Binding Offer

Banks issue a binding FEIN + FIAE. You must wait a mandatory reflection period (usually 10 days).

### Signing (Escritura + Hipoteca)

You sign at a notary. On the same day, the mortgage is activated and the bank transfers funds.

## 2. Brokers: When They Help

Brokers simplify comparisons and negotiate conditions. Some are free (paid by banks), others charge a fee. Downsides: limited bank selection and potential pressure.

## 3. Mortgage Types

### Fixed

Rate stays constant for the entire duration. Predictable, stable payments. Good in rising-rate environments.

### Variable

Based on Euribor + differential. Payments change every 6–12 months. Cheaper initially but riskier.

### Mixed

Fixed period (usually 5–10 years), then variable. A middle ground when future rates are uncertain.

### Understanding Euribor

Euribor reflects average borrowing costs between European banks. It strongly influences variable and mixed mortgages. Rising Euribor increases monthly payments.

## 4. Bank Offers: How to Read Them

### Key Concepts

* **TIN**: nominal interest rate.
* **TAE**: effective rate including commissions and linked products.
* **Linked Products**: banks often offer discounts for using their insurance, credit card, payroll, or pension plans.

### FEIN and FIAE

These documents detail the final offer. They are legally binding and allow comparisons across banks.

## 5. Comparing Options

Evaluate:

* Monthly payment now.
* Total cost over the entire mortgage.
* Early repayment penalties.
* Flexibility for amortization.
* Impact of linked products.

A small spreadsheet with scenarios (Euribor ±1–2%) helps reveal long-term cost differences.

## 6. Savings from Cancelling Linked Services

Banks often push expensive insurance products. After the first year, many can be replaced externally at a much lower cost. This may raise your interest slightly but often still results in large lifetime savings.

## 7. Extra Amortizations

Amortizing early reduces interest dramatically, especially if you shorten the term.

### Term Reduction vs. Payment Reduction

* **Term reduction**: saves more interest.
* **Payment reduction**: lowers monthly cost but saves less overall.

Even small yearly amortizations can remove years from the mortgage and save thousands in interest.

## 8. Legal Costs and Taxes

* **Appraisal (tasación)**: paid by the borrower, typically €300–€500.
* **Notary, registry, and AJD tax** for the mortgage are now paid by the bank (post-2019 law).
* For the property purchase itself, the buyer pays ITP (6–10%) or VAT + AJD (if new).
* Other costs: notary for the purchase deed, land registry, gestoría, and any opening commission (if applicable).

## 9. Tax Benefits

* No general IRPF deduction unless the home was purchased before 2013.
* Some Autonomous Communities offer regional deductions for young buyers, large families, etc.
* Always check local benefits; Basque Country and Navarre have specific deductions.

## 10. Post-Signing Actions: Novación and Subrogación

* **Novación**: renegotiate with the same bank to modify interest rate, term, or other conditions.
* **Subrogación (creditor)**: move your mortgage to another bank to get better terms.
* **Subrogación (debtor)**: transfer the mortgage to a buyer if you sell the property.
* Banks may charge small fees for these changes, but they are often worth it.

## 11. Special Mortgage Types

### Self-Build (Autopromotor)

* Designed for building your own home.
* Funds released in stages based on construction progress.
* Requires land ownership and detailed building plans.

### Green Mortgages

* Offered for properties with high energy ratings (A or B).
* Typically come with a small interest rate discount.

### Cooperative Housing

* You buy into a cooperative and make payments during construction.
* Often cheaper and can include a pre-arranged mortgage to subrogate at delivery.

## Conclusion

The mortgage process in Spain is long but manageable with clarity and preparation. Understanding offer structures, Euribor exposure, amortization strategies, and linked products allows buyers to save substantial money while reducing stress. With awareness of taxes, refinancing options, and niche mortgage products, you can make confident, informed decisions every step of the way.
