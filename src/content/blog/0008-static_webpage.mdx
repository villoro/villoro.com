Here you can learn how to create a static webpage using Flask.
Check the full example on <FancyLink linkText="Github" url="https://github.com/villoro/villoro_posts/tree/master/016-static_webpage" dark="true"/>.

You only need some **html** knowledge.

## 1. Install requirements

Run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the following libraries:
```yaml
flask: to create the webpage
frozen-flask: to make it static
markdown: to transform from markdown to html
oyaml: to work with ordered yamls
pygments: to display beautiful code snipets when transforming markdown
```

## 2. html templates
The first thing you will need are some `html` templates. I suggest that you use at least one `base.html` as the basic template and then other templates for each page.

The `base.html` file should have the basic structure, for example:

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  `src/templates/base.html`
</TerminalOutput>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <title>Test page</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

  <!-- Custom styles -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='villoro.css') }}">

  <body>
    <!-- Add children body -->
    {% block body %}{% endblock %}
  </body>
</html>
```

<Notice type="info" className="mt-6">
  The template I created in github has a `navbar` and `footer` but the basics are the same.
</Notice>

Then we can create the `about.html` page template using:

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  `src/templates/about.html`
</TerminalOutput>
```jinja
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block body%}
  <div class="w3-content w3-padding">
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>

    {% autoescape false %} {{ description }} {% endautoescape %}

  </div>
{% endblock %}
```

<Notice type="info">
  `{{ title }}` and `{{ description }}` are parameters that we will pass to the flask template.
</Notice>


## 3. Flask app and freezer

The `index.py` will be the actual `Flask` app. It will only render the templates.

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  `src/index.py`
</TerminalOutput>
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

@APP.route("/about.html")
def about():
    """ about me page """

    return render_template("about.html", title="Title1", description="Hello world")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    APP.run(debug=True)
```

<Notice type="info">
  As you can see we are passing `title` and `description` as parameters as commented before.
</Notice>


Now you can run `python src/index.py` to view the app at `localhost:5000`.

Then you can create the `freeze.py` file that will create the static html files.

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  `src/freeze.py`
</TerminalOutput>
```python
from flask_frozen import Freezer
from index import APP

FREEZER = Freezer(APP)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    FREEZER.freeze()
```

Now if you run `python src/freeze.py` you will crate the folder `src/build` with the static webpage.

## 4. Using yamls
In order to make it easier to customize the pages I suggest using `yaml` files. They are like `json` files but more compact.

For example you can create the file `about.yaml` with:

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  `src/content/about.yaml`
</TerminalOutput>
```yaml
title: Title 1
description: Hello **world**
```

I suggest that you also transform the description from **markdown** to **html** since it will give you more flexibility.
To do all of that you should modify the file `index.py` to read that `yaml`.

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  `src/index.py`
</TerminalOutput>
```python
import oyaml as yaml

from markdown import markdown
from flask import Flask, render_template

APP = Flask(__name__)


def _read_yaml(filename):
    """ auxiliar function to raad a yaml """

    with open(f"src/content/{filename}.yaml", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        out = yaml.load(file)

    # Transform from markdown to html
    if "description" in out:
        out["description"] = markdown(out["description"], extensions=["fenced_code", "codehilite"])

    return out

@APP.route("/about.html")
def about():
    """ about me page """

    return render_template("about.html", **_read_yaml("about"))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    APP.run(debug=True)
```

## 5. css and images
To use custom `css` files and/or images simply place them in the folder `src/static/`. For using them you can:

```html
<!-- Use a css -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='file.css') }}">

<!-- Use an image -->
<img src="/static/image.jpg" alt="image"/>
```

## 6. Hosting the webpage

I strongly recommend using <FancyLink linkText="Netlify" url="https://www.netlify.com/"/> since they do a lot of things for free. Some of them you probably didn't know that you should do them (or at least I didn't).

It is really easy to set up. The most imporant steps are:

1. Login with your github account.
2. Link to the repository where you have the project
3. Tell the build command (which should be `python src/freeze.py`)

And with that you will have your custom static webpage up and running. It will be very fast and very customizable.
