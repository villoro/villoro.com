Amazon is one of the most important infrastructure services provider. This includes computing power, storage, networking and databases among the a lot of others. One of the computing service that it offers are the **EC2** instances. In this post I am going to explain how to set up an Ubuntu server using an EC2 instance.

## 1. Create an EC2 instance

First of all go to <FancyLink linkText="AWS console" url="https://aws.amazon.com/" company="aws"/> and log in. From there it is important to select the **Region** where you want your services. You should select somewhere that is close to the locations that will receive most traffic. In my case I will use `UE (London)` since is close to where I live.

Using the AWS navigation go to `EC2` and press `Launch Instance`. I would suggest you start with a `Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS`.

For the configuration of the instance I suggest the following:

1. Create a new instance
    *  Use `t2.micro` (it is included in the **free tier**) or t3.micro (not in **free tier** but cheaper than `t2` family). You can change it later to a more powerful instance if needed.
2. Next (Configure Instance details)
    * If you selected an instance of the `t3` family disable the `T2/T3 Unlimited` to reduce costs.
3. Next (Add storage).
    * 8 GB might not be enough. Increase the storage size if needed.
4. Next (Add tags)
    * Here you can define tags to classify the instances. It can be very useful to classify the costs (<FancyLink linkText="Cost Allocation" url="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html" company="aws"/>)
5. Next (Security groups)
    * Here you can define which **IP** can access and which **ports** they can use to enter the instance. I suggest that right now you only use your IP.
6. Review and Launch
7. Create a new key pair
    * This will be used to log in usin **SSH** to the instance. It is **very important to store this key in a safe place** (the `.pem` file).
8. Launch Instances

<Notice type="warning">
  Some people have a **dynamic IP**. If this is your case and you have restricted the access to the instance you should update periodically the Security Group so that you can allways access the instance.
</Notice>

## 2. Accessing the instance
You can access your instance through an SSH connection. I suggest using the open source <FancyLink linkText="PuTTY" url="https://www.putty.org/" company="default" dark="true"/>.

### 2.1. Transform pem to ppk
After installing PuTTY open `PuTTYgen` to transform the `.pem` file with the key to a `.ppk`.

1. Select load and import the `.pem` file.
2. Select `Save private key` and store the `ppk` file.
3. Open the `ppk` file key so that it gets loaded into PuTTY.

### 2.2. Access the EC2 with SSH
1. From the AWS console at the EC2 page find the public IP of the instance you just created (The format should be XX.XXX.XXX.XXX where X are numbers).
2. Write that IP into PuTTY and do not change the port (22).
3. Select `Open`
4. Accept the Security Alert (`Yes`)
5. Log in using `ubuntu` as user. The key you just imported should serve as password (you should not write anything)


## 3. Do something with the instance
If you did all the above correctly you should have a fully working `Ubuntu` instance and a connection with PuTTY through `SSH`.

From here you can do whatever you want with it.

### 3.1. Set up python (Optional)
Since I use python in almost every project I will include how to set it up.

First check that you have python 3 installed with the command:

```sh
python3

# It should open python 3.X if it has worked you can closed it with:
exit()
```

Then install `pip3` as a python package manager with:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install python3-pip -y

pip3 freeze # To check it has worked
```

Right now you can use python calling `python3` and install packages with `pip3 install X`

And that's it, you have your own server!

In the next posts I will explain some things you can do with that server.
