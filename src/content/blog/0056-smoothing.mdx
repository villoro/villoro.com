## 0. Why Smoothing Matters (and Why It‚Äôs Not That Simple)

I‚Äôve spent hours‚Äîmaybe days‚Äîtrying to find the "perfect" way to smooth a time series. I didn‚Äôt just want a trend line‚ÄîI wanted a smoothed *series*‚Äîthe kind you often see in polished dashboards, where the noise fades and the pattern becomes obvious. I remembered seeing some tools that seemed to use something close to a Gaussian smoother, and that became my benchmark.

So I tried everything: simple moving averages, exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA), Kalman filters, even rolling medians. Some were too noisy, others too laggy. I wanted something that respected the data's structure while highlighting the trend.

This post walks through that journey‚Äîfrom the most basic methods to more advanced, expressive smoothers. We‚Äôll also explore what can and can‚Äôt be done in SQL, and why not every smoother belongs in a database.

Along the way, I‚Äôll show visual comparisons using the same time series, so you can see exactly what each technique does‚Äîand where it shines or fails.

To do so, I'll use the following time series with daily data:

## 1. Timeframe Reduction
The simplest way to smooth a time series is by reducing its granularity.

**Pros:**
- Naturally removes noise through aggregation
- Simple and performant in SQL
- Useful when precision isn't critical

**Cons:**
- **Loss of resolution:** You trade detail for clarity
- **Harder comparisons:** Aggregated results may hide important local variation

## 2. Smoothing with Python: From Simple to Smart

### üîÅ Moving Average
A moving average is the most common starting point for smoothing. It replaces each point with the average of its neighbors over a fixed-size window.

**Pros:**
- Simple to understand and implement
- Reduces high-frequency noise

**Cons:**
- **Not very smooth:** Especially with small windows, the result is spiky and lacks continuity
- **Sensitive to new data:** Trailing averages can react too fast or too slow, depending on window size
- **Centering trade-off:** Centered windows yield a more accurate reflection of the trend but introduce delay, making the method unsuitable for real-time contexts
- **Edge handling:** The start and end of the series are harder to estimate cleanly

We'll apply both trailing and centered versions and compare their impact on the series.

### üéØ Gaussian Smoother (`tsmoothie`)
Gaussian smoothing uses a weighted moving average where weights follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. Points closer to the center of the window receive higher weight.

**Pros:**
- Produces a very smooth, continuous curve
- Reduces noise while preserving general structure
- Tunable via the `sigma` parameter for controlling smoothness

**Cons:**
- **Window size matters:** Too large and you may lose important fluctuations; too small and it behaves like a basic moving average
- **Still linear:** Doesn‚Äôt adapt to non-linear trends or local curvature
- **Requires parameter tuning:** Choosing a good `sigma` isn‚Äôt always obvious

We can apply Gaussian smoothing using <FancyLink linkText="tsmoothie" url="https://github.com/cerlymarco/tsmoothie/tree/master" dark="true"/>:

```python
from tsmoothie.smoother import GaussianSmoother

smoother = GaussianSmoother(n_knots=6, sigma=0.1)
smoother.smooth(df["numeric_column"])
df["gaussian"] = smoother.smooth_data[0]
```

<canvas id="plot_gaussian" style="width:100%;height:300px;"></canvas>

### üìà Lowess Smoother (`tsmoothie`)
Lowess (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing) fits a local linear regression at each point using weighted neighboring data.

**Pros:**
- Adapts to local patterns‚Äîgreat for non-linear trends
- Handles seasonal variation and local curvature very well
- Smoother than a moving average or Gaussian, especially with complex signals

**Cons:**
- **Computationally expensive:** Especially on large datasets (O(n^2) in na√Øve implementations)
- **Not interpretable in real-time:** Being a centered smoother, it relies on future values
- **No clear parameters:** Tuning the fraction of data used (`frac`) requires experimentation

We can also apply Lowess smoothing using <FancyLink linkText="tsmoothie" url="https://github.com/cerlymarco/tsmoothie/tree/master" dark="true"/>:

```python
from tsmoothie.smoother import LowessSmoother

smoother = LowessSmoother(smooth_fraction=0.2, iterations=1)
smoother.smooth(df["numeric_column"])
df["lowess"] = smoother.smooth_data[0]
```

<canvas id="plot_lowess" style="width:100%;height:300px;"></canvas>

## 3. Smoothing with SQL: What‚Äôs Possible, What‚Äôs Not

### ‚ùå Why no Gaussian or Lowess in SQL?
Techniques like Gaussian smoothing and Lowess require iterative, weighted, and often non-linear computations‚Äîsomething SQL just isn't designed for. You can‚Äôt easily apply convolution or perform local regressions inside a SQL query.

SQL engines don‚Äôt support weighted kernels or local least-squares fitting. While it's possible to simulate some behaviors using window functions and recursive queries, the complexity and performance penalties make it impractical.

### üìä Median Smoothing
SQL *can* do robust smoothing with medians:

**Pros:**
- Robust to outliers, making it better for noisy series
- Available in many modern SQL engines via window functions

**Cons:**
- **Hard edges:** Like the moving average, it produces sharp transitions, especially when values shift abruptly
- **Still lags:** As with other rolling functions, it introduces temporal lag
- **Computational cost:** Rolling medians are heavier than means in most engines

You can compute the median over a window with:

```sql
SELECT
    start_day,
    MEDIAN(value) OVER (ORDER BY start_day ROWS BETWEEN 15 PRECEDING AND 15 FOLLOWING) AS mov_median
FROM data
ORDER BY 1 DESC
```

<canvas id="plot_median" style="width:100%;height:300px;"></canvas>

### üéπ Quantile Bands
Quantile smoothing provides additional context:

**Pros:**
- Gives a sense of spread and volatility
- Easy to implement using `PERCENTILE_CONT`
- Useful for detecting changes in distribution or trends

**Cons:**
- **Not a smoother per se:** Quantiles don't create a smoothed line, but rather bands
- **Limited interpretability:** Requires visual support to be useful

There is no standard for calculating quantiles in SQL. As an example, here‚Äôs how it can be done with <FancyLink linkText="DuckDB" url="https://duckdb.org/" dark="true"/>:

```sql
SELECT
    start_day,
    MEDIAN(value) OVER win AS mavg,
    quantile_cont(value, 0.10) OVER win AS p10,
    quantile_cont(value, 0.90) OVER win AS p90
FROM data
WINDOW win AS (ORDER BY start_day ROWS BETWEEN 15 PRECEDING AND 15 FOLLOWING)
ORDER BY 1 DESC
```

You can also partition by one or more categories with:

```sql
SELECT
    start_day,
    category,
    MEDIAN(value) OVER win AS mavg,
    quantile_cont(value, 0.10) OVER win AS p10,
    quantile_cont(value, 0.90) OVER win AS p90
FROM data
WINDOW 
    win AS (
        PARTITION BY category
        ORDER BY start_day
        ROWS BETWEEN 15 PRECEDING AND 15 FOLLOWING  
    )
ORDER BY 1 DESC
```

## 4. Side-by-Side Comparison

To wrap up, we‚Äôll place all techniques side by side:

<canvas id="plot_all" style="width:100%;height:300px;"></canvas>

- Raw time series
- Moving average
- Gaussian smoother
- Lowess smoother
- SQL median + quantiles + downsampling

This comparison will help you decide which approach works best, depending on your tech stack and the level of fidelity you need.

Stay tuned for code samples, math notes, and visualizations.
