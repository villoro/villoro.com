## 0. The problem

Handling project version numbers is painful and can be tedious if not automated.
To make matters worse, we often need to update the version in multiple files.

This post will explain how to simplify this process and how to automate it.
It only focuses on how to manage it using `poetry` since it's the tool I recommend for handling virtual environments.
If you need to set up **Poetry**, see: <FancyLink linkText="Poetry python package manager" url="https://villoro.com/blog/poetry-python-package-manager" dark="true"/>

## 1. `poetry-bumpversion`

With <FancyLink linkText="Poetry-bumpversion" url="https://pypi.org/project/poetry-bumpversion/"/>, we can easily update the package version.

It assumes you follow <FancyLink linkText="Semver" url="https://semver.org/" company="default" dark="true"/> for the versioning of the project.

<Notice type="warning">
  If you are not following <FancyLink linkText="Semver" url="https://semver.org/" company="default" dark="true"/>, you probably should since it's the standard.
</Notice>

In short with `semver` the version consists of three numbers (`M.m.p`) where:

* `M`: major version. Represents breaking changes
* `m`: minor version. Represents relevant changes
* `p`: patch version. For fixes without new functionallity

### 1.1. Installing `poetry-bumpversion`

You can do it with:

```bash
# If you don't have Poetry installed, first do:
pip install poetry

# Add poetry-bumpversion
poetry self add poetry-bumpversion

# Make sure to install the poetry dependencies again with:
poetry install
```

### 1.2. Updating the version in `pyproject.toml`

You can do it by running:

```bash
poetry version major
poetry version minor
poetry version patch
```

### 1.3. Updating other files

Frequently you will have other files that declare the version.
For example, you could have `dbt_project.yml` if you are using `DBT`.
In that case, you will need to declare in `pyproject.toml` the files you want to update along with the format it should look for.
As an example for DBT:

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  /pyproject.toml
</TerminalOutput>
```toml
[[tool.poetry_bumpversion.replacements]]
files = ["dbt_project.yml"]
search = "version: '{current_version}'"
replace = "version: '{new_version}'"
```

## 2. Automatically validate versions

The idea is to create a GitHub action that automatically validates that the version is updated.
This way you can decide if you want to increase the `major`, `minor`, or `patch` digit.

<Notice type="info">
  In this example, if the version is not manually updated, the CI will fail.
</Notice>

The first thing you need is a simple script that reads the package version from `pyproject.toml`:

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  /.github/scripts/get_version.py
</TerminalOutput>
```python
import click
import toml
from loguru import logger as log

from utils import set_output

PYPROJECT_FILE = "pyproject.toml"


@click.command()
@click.option("--name")
def get_version(name):
    version = toml.load(PYPROJECT_FILE)["tool"]["poetry"]["version"]
    log.info(f"'{name}' branch {version=}")

    set_output(f"VERSION_{name.upper()}", version)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_version()
```

This scripts uses the `set_output`  function to export the version as an environment variable in GitHub action.
Since this is used in another `python` script, it is declared in a `utils.py` file:

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  /.github/scripts/utils.py
</TerminalOutput>
```python
import os

from loguru import logger as log


def set_output(name, value):
    log.info(f"Setting {name=} {value=}")
    with open(os.environ["GITHUB_ENV"], "a") as fh:
        print(f"{name}={value}", file=fh)

```

<Notice type="info" className="mt-6">
  For more details about using `environment variables` in `Github actions` see `section 4`
</Notice>

Then you will need a script that checks if the version needs to be updated.
It will compare the version from `main` to the one in the current PR.

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  /.github/scripts/check_if_update_needed.py
</TerminalOutput>
```python
import click

from packaging import version
from loguru import logger as log

@click.command()
@click.option("--version_current")
@click.option("--version_main")
def compare_versions(version_current, version_main):
    log.info(f"Running with {version_current=}, {version_main=}")

    version_current = version.parse(version_current)
    version_main = version.parse(version_main)
    
    if version_current <= version_main:
        logger.error("Version needs to be updated")
        exit(1)

    logger.success(f"Version is correctly updated")
    exit(0)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    compare_versions()
```

And the last step is to create a GitHub action that validates the version:

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  /.github/workflow/fix_version.yaml
</TerminalOutput>
```yaml
name: Fix Version

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - dbt_northius/**
      - poetry.lock
      - pyproject.toml

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  fix:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4

      # Install requirements. Should match Dockerfile versions
      - name: Install requirements
        run: pip install poetry==1.6.1 poetry-bumpversion==0.3.1 toml loguru click

      # Get version from main
      - name: Checkout main
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: main
      - name: Get main version
        run: python .github/scripts/get_version.py --name=main

      # Get version from the current branch
      - name: Checkout current branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          # Those are needed because of https://github.com/EndBug/add-and-commit#working-with-prs
          repository: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
      - name: Get current version
        run: python .github/scripts/get_version.py --name=current

      # Checks if version needs updating
      - name: Check if version needs to be updated
        run: python .github/scripts/check_if_update_needed.py --version_current=$VERSION_CURRENT --version_main=$VERSION_MAIN

      # Update only when needed
      - name: Update version
        if: env.NEEDS_UPDATE == 'true'
        run: poetry version minor

      # Commit changes and force GitHub_status to be updated
      - name: Commit new version
        if: env.NEEDS_UPDATE == 'true'
        uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v9
        with:
          default_author: github_actions
          message: "Poetry minor version update"
```

<Notice type="info" className="mt-6">
  Notice that if there are multiple commits on the same PR the older runs will be canceled.
  More info in <FancyLink linkText="Using concurrency and the default behavior" url="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency#example-using-concurrency-and-the-default-behavior" dark="true"/>
</Notice>

The way this works is by:

1. Extracting the version in `main` branch
2. Extracting the version from the current branch in the pull request
3. If `current_version <= main_version`, then fail

## 3. Automatically tag versions

In order to keep better tracking of the package version, we will be tagging all commits to `main` with their version.
We can do that with the following GitHub action:

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  /.github/workflow/tag_commits_on_main.yaml
</TerminalOutput>
```yaml
name: Tag

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - pyproject.toml

jobs:
  tag_with_version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4

      - name: Install requirements
        run: pip install toml loguru click

      - name: Checkout current branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Get current version
        run: python .github/scripts/get_version.py --name=current

      - name: Tag commit with current version
        uses: actions/github-script@v5
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.git.createRef({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              ref: `refs/tags/${{env.VERSION_CURRENT}}`,
              sha: context.sha
            })
```

## 4. Environment variables in github actions

One of the ways of passing information from one step in a GitHub action to another is by using environment variables.

### 4.1. Storing data in an environment variable

There is a couple of ways of storing data in an environment variable.
This first one would be with an `echo` like:

```yaml
- name: Get main version
  run: echo "VERSION_CURRENT=$(python scripts/get_version.py)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

In this example you would need `scripts/get_version.py` to output the version.

The second option is to do it directly with python with:

```python
def set_output(name, value):
    """
    Args:
        name:  name of the environment variable
        value: value to store in the environment variable
    with open(os.environ["GITHUB_ENV"], "a") as fh:
        print(f"{name}={value}", file=fh)
```

### 4.2. Retrevient data from an environment variable

To retrieve the environment variable, simply use `$ENV_VAR_NAME` like:

```yaml
- name: Check if version needs to be updated
  run: python .github/scripts/check_if_update_needed.py --version_current=$VERSION_CURRENT --version_main=$VERSION_MAIN
```

Notice that in the `tag_commits_on_main.yaml` GitHub action, we are using the value directly within a string.
This is done with:

```sh
`text ${{env.ENV_VAR_NAME}}`
```

Like we saw in the previous snippet:

```yaml
- name: Tag commit with current version
  uses: actions/github-script@v5
  with:
    script: |
      github.rest.git.createRef({
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
        ref: `refs/tags/${{env.VERSION_CURRENT}}`,
        sha: context.sha
      })
```
