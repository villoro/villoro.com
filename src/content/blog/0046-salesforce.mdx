## 1. Simple Salesforce

There are multiple ways of querying Salesforce data with python.
I like using <FancyLink linkText="Simple Salesforce" url="https://github.com/simple-salesforce/simple-salesforce" dark="true"/> because as it's name suggest it makes it quite simple to extract data.

We aware that in the <FancyLink linkText="Official documentation | Simple Salesforce" url="https://simple-salesforce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"/> there are a lot of missing functions.
So I suggest you also take a look at the github readme.

To start with it, you need to instanciate `Salesforce` as follows

```python
from simple_salesforce import Salesforce

sf = Salesforce(
    username="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    consumer_key="your_consumer_key",
    consumer_secret="your_consumer_secret",
)
```
<Notice type="warning">
  Make sure to change all strings with proper values

### 1.1. Querying and `__getattr__`

This is the most simple query you can do:

```python
sf.Account.get('003e0000003GuNXAA0')
```

Notice that we are querying the entity `Account` and that to do so you need to access the `Account` attribute from the `sf` object.
That makes pipelines a little bit more complex than needed, but you can use `__getattr__("name")` to get the attribute in a programatic way from the entity name.
As an example, both statements do the same:

```python
sf.Account.get('003e0000003GuNXAA0')

sf.__getattr__("Account").get('003e0000003GuNXAA0')
```

<Notice type="success" className="mt-6">
  That can be applied almost everywhere in this post

## 2. Querying options

There are multiple ways of getting data from Salesforce using <FancyLink linkText="Simple Salesforce" url="https://github.com/simple-salesforce/simple-salesforce" dark="true"/> library.
Here is a detailed overview of all of them:

|                             | get | query | query_all | query_all_iter | bulk.query_all | bulk2.query |
|-----------------------------|-----|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Batch Querying              | ❌ | ✔️    | ✔️       | ✔️             | ✔️            | ✔️          |
| No need of pagination       | -   | ❌   | ✔️        | ✔️            | ✔️             | ✔️         |
| Iterable (no memory errors) | -   | ❌   | ❌        | ✔️            | ⚠️            | ✔️          |
| Result as python object     | ✔️ | ✔️    | ✔️       | ✔️             | ✔️            | ❌          |
| Includes deleted            | ❌ | ✔️    | ✔️       | ✔️             | ✔️            | ❌          |
| Can query compound data (*) | -   | ✔️   | ✔️       | ✔️             | ❌            | ❌          |

<Notice type="warning">
  (\*) More info about compound data in section 4.
</Notice>

And here you can see the query time of each method using the same query:

<canvas id="sf_querying_times" style="width:100%;height:300px;"></canvas>

<Notice type="success" className="mt-6">
  I would recommend using either `query_all_iter`.
</Notice>

### 2.1. Entity get

You can use the `get` method to retrive a single entity:

```python
sf.Account.get('003e0000003GuNXAA0')
```

<Notice type="warning">
  While useful for getting a value it's not suited for exporing large number of rows.
</Notice>

### 2.2. query

You can use `sf.query` to retrive multiple rows at the same time.
The number of records you can get is limited and if your query exceeds them you will need to call `sf.query_more`.

You can do that with the following code:

```python
sf.query("SELECT Id, Name FROM Account")

# The previous call will have: "nextRecordsUrl" : "/services/data/v26.0/query/01gD0000002HU6KIAW-2000
sf.query_more("01gD0000002HU6KIAW-2000")
```

You can read more about it in <FancyLink linkText="Queries | Simple Salesforce" url="https://simple-salesforce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/queries.html"/>.

<Notice type="warning">
  I don't suggest using this option since there are others that are easier to use without needing to deal with the `sf.query_more` option.
</Notice>

### 2.3. query_all

This method is the same as before but it returns all results as a python object:

```python
sf.query_all("SELECT Id, Name FROM Account")
```

<Notice type="warning">
  The problem with that is that you can easily get `Out of Memory (OOM)` errors when trying to bring a lot of data into memory.
</Notice>

### 2.4. query_all_iter

This works similarly to the previous methods but the result is an iterator.
This way you can process each row at a time and avoid `Out of Memory (OOM)` errors.

It would work like:

```python
query = "SELECT Id, Name FROM Account"
data = sf.query_all_iter(, include_deleted=True)

for row in data:
    process(row)
```

Under the hood it manages to get the records in bulk.
You can notice this because when you try to query a lot of data the first row will take longer than the rest.

<Notice type="warning">
  This is the method I recommend using
</Notice>

### 2.5. Bulk

There is two ways of querying with `bulk`, the regular one and the lazy operation.
The first one works similarly to `query_all_iter` where you can iterate over the results (no OOM errors).
The lazy one is like `query_all` which brings evertying as one batch. 

Here is the regular call:

```python
query = "SELECT Id, Name FROM Account"

# generator on the results page
data = sf.bulk.Account.query_all(query)

# the generator provides the list of results for every call to next()
for row in data:
    process(row)
```

And this is how to call it lazilly:
```python
query = "SELECT Id, Name FROM Account"

# generator on the results page
data = sf.bulk.Account.query_all(query, lazy_operation=True)

# the generator provides the list of results for every call to next()
for chunk in data:
    process(chunk)
```
<Notice type="info">
  Notice that `chunk` contains all rows
</Notice>

<Notice type="warning">
  This function is consistently **2 to 3 times faster** than `query_all_iter`.
  However since it cannot extract compound fields it would make extraction more complex, since you would need to recreate all that logic in the datalake.
</Notice>

### 2.6. Bulk2

Finally there is also the `bulk2` option.

```python
query = "SELECT Id, Name FROM Account"

results = sf.bulk2.Account.query(
    query, max_records=50000, column_delimiter="COMM", line_ending="LF"
)

for i, data in enumerate(results):
    with open(f"results/part-{1}.csv", "w") as bos:
        bos.write(data)
```

With this one the iterator returns batches of the asked size (`max_records`).
One important caveat is that the result is a python string similar to a `csv`.

<Notice type="warning">
  That means extra work for parsing that result, such as handling problems with separators, encodings issues, extra I/O operations etc.
</Notice>

When testing, I saw around a 20% performance improvement compared to `bulk`.
Given that it's not high I think it's not worth the effort.

## 3. Query limits

### 3.1. Batches

### 3.2. Max days per query

## 4. Types of fields

Fields (or Columns) in Salesforce are flexible and they can contain different types of data.
I like to classify fields in three types:

1. **Primitive fields**: those show information about the entity itself.
2. **Reference fields**: those are links to other tables, similar to a join.
3. **Compound fields**: those are formulas based on other fields. Those fields can be from referenced tables.

### 4.1. Primitive fields

Those are the basic type of fields. They show information about the entity itself.
For example, if we are working with the `User` table, it will have some primitive fields like:

* `firstname`: the name of the user (string)
* `age`: how old the user is (int)

### 4.2. Reference fields

Those fields are references to other tables.
Under the hood they behave similarly to a `join` in SQL.

The 2 important parts of reference fields are:

* `referenceTo`: this shows to which entity the field refers to
* `relationshipName`: the name that entity will have. Think of it as the alias after a join

Here you have a sample of reference fields:

| name             | type      | referenceTo     | relationshipName |
|------------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| CreatedById      | reference | [User]          | CreatedBy        |
| LastModifiedById | reference | [User]          | LastModifiedBy   |
| Delegation__c    | reference | [Delegation__c] | Delegation__r    |
| User__c          | reference | [User]          | User__r          |

### 4.3. Compound fields (Calculated fields)

Those fields are populated at query time based on a formula.
For example, in the `User` table we could have `firstName` and `lastName` as primitive fields and then `fullName` defined as `FirstName & ’ ’ & LastName`. More info at <FancyLink linkText="Compound fields" url="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/compound_fields.htm"/>.

<Notice type="warning">
  Compound fields can use information from `referenced` entities!
</Notice>

Let's imagine the we have the `Order` table which has those fields (among others):

| name             | type      | referenceTo | relationshipName                                      |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| CreatedById      | reference | [User]      | CreatedBy                                             |
| LastModifiedById | reference | [User]      | LastModifiedBy                                        |
| User__c          | reference | [User]      | <span style="background-color:yellow;">User__r</span> |

We could have here a **calculated** field called `fullName` with the following formula: `User__r.FirstName & ’ ’ & User__r.LastName`.

In that case, `fullName` will have information based on the table `Users` and not the `Orders`.

<Notice type="error">
  When extracting data those fields are very dangerous since **changes in the referenced table does not modify the `LastModifiedDate` from the main table**.
  In the example above, we would see a different `fullName` if `User.FirstName` is modified but the `Order` table will have the same `LastModifiedDate` as before, since the `Order` table hasn't been modified. This is dangerous for data extractions.
</Notice>

## 5. Query including external changes

| name             | calculated | calculatedFormula | type      | referenceTo     | relationshipName                                                |
|------------------|------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

| Name             | False      |                   | string    |                 |                                                                 |
| CreatedDate      | False      |                   | datetime  |                 |                                                                 |
| LastModifiedDate | False      |                   | datetime  |                 |                                                                 |
