## 1. Simple Salesforce

There are multiple ways of querying Salesforce data with python.
I like using <FancyLink linkText="Simple Salesforce" url="https://github.com/simple-salesforce/simple-salesforce" dark="true"/> because as it's name suggest it makes it quite simple to extract data.

We aware that in the <FancyLink linkText="Official documentation | Simple Salesforce" url="https://simple-salesforce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"/> there are a lot of missing functions.
So I suggest you also take a look at the github readme.

To start with it, you need to instanciate `Salesforce` as follows

```python
from simple_salesforce import Salesforce

sf = Salesforce(
    username="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    consumer_key="your_consumer_key",
    consumer_secret="your_consumer_secret",
)
```

  Make sure to change all strings with proper values

### 1.1. Querying and `__getattr__`

This is the most simple query you can do:

```python
sf.Contact.get('003e0000003GuNXAA0')
```

Notice that we are querying the entity `Contact` and that to do so you need to access the `Contact` attribute from the `sf` object.
That makes pipelines a little bit more complex than needed, but you can use `__getattr__("name")` to get the attribute in a programatic way from the entity name.
As an example, both statements do the same:

```python
sf.Contact.get('003e0000003GuNXAA0')

sf.__getattr__("Contact").get('003e0000003GuNXAA0')
```

<Notice type="success" className="mt-6">
  That can be applied almost everywhere in this post

## 2. Querying options

There are multiple ways of getting data from Salesforce using <FancyLink linkText="Simple Salesforce" url="https://github.com/simple-salesforce/simple-salesforce" dark="true"/> library.
Here is a detailed overview of all of them:

|                             | get | query | query_all | query_all_iter | bulk.query_all | bulk2.query |
|-----------------------------|-----|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Batch Querying              | ❌ | ✔️    | ✔️       | ✔️             | ✔️            | ✔️          |
| No need of pagination       | -   | ❌   | ✔️        | ✔️            | ✔️             | ✔️         |
| Iterable (no memory errors) | -   | ❌   | ❌        | ✔️            | ✔️            | ✔️          |
| Result as python object     | ✔️ | ✔️    | ✔️       | ✔️             | ✔️            | ❌          |
| Includes deleted            | ❌ | ✔️    | ✔️       | ✔️             | ✔️            | ❌          |

<Notice type="info">
  I would recommend using either `query_all_iter` or `bulk.query_all`.
</Notice>

### 2.1. Entity get

`sf.Contact.get('003e0000003GuNXAA0')`

### 2.2. query

https://simple-salesforce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/queries.html

```python
sf.query("SELECT Id, Email, ParentAccount.Name FROM Contact WHERE LastName = 'Jones'")
```

### 2.3. query_all

```python
sf.query_all("SELECT Id, Email FROM Contact WHERE LastName = 'Jones'")
```

### 2.4. query_all_iter

```python
data = sf.query_all_iter("SELECT Id, Email FROM Contact WHERE LastName = 'Jones'")

for row in data:
    process(row)
```

### 2.5. Bulk

```python
query = 'SELECT Id, Name FROM Account'

# generator on the results page
data = sf.bulk.Account.query_all(query, lazy_operation=True)

# the generator provides the list of results for every call to next()
for row in data:
    process(row)
```

### 2.6. Bulk2

```python
query = 'SELECT Id, Name FROM Account LIMIT 100000'

results = sf.bulk2.Account.query(
    query, max_records=50000, column_delimiter="COMM", line_ending="LF"
)

for i, data in enumerate(results):
    with open(f"results/part-{1}.csv", "w") as bos:
        bos.write(data)
```

## 4. Types of columns

Columns in Salesforce are flexible and they can contain different types of data.
I like to classify columns in three types:

1. **Primitive columns**: those show information about the entity itself.
2. **Reference columns**: those are links to other tables, similar to a join.
3. **Calculated columns**: those are formulas based on other fields. Those fields can be from referenced tables.

### 4.1. Primitive columns

Those are the basic type of columns. They show information about the entity itself.
For example, if we are working with the `User` table, it will have some primitive columns like:

* `firstname`: the name of the user (string)
* `age`: how old the user is (int)

### 4.2. Reference columns

Those columns are references to other tables.
Under the hood they behave similarly to a `join` in SQL.

The 2 important parts of reference columns are:

* `referenceTo`: this shows to which entity the column refers to
* `relationshipName`: the name that entity will have. Think of it as the alias after a join

Here you have a sample of reference columns:

| name             | type      | referenceTo     | relationshipName |
|------------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| CreatedById      | reference | [User]          | CreatedBy        |
| LastModifiedById | reference | [User]          | LastModifiedBy   |
| Delegation__c    | reference | [Delegation__c] | Delegation__r    |
| User__c          | reference | [User]          | User__r          |

### 4.3. Calculated columns

Those columns are populated at query time based on a formula.
For example, in the `User` table we could have `firstName` and `lastName` as primitive columns and then `fullName` defined as `FirstName & ’ ’ & LastName`.

<Notice type="warning">
  Calculated columns can use information from `referenced` entities!
</Notice>

Let's imagine the we have the `Order` table which has those columns (among others):

| name             | type      | referenceTo | relationshipName                                      |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| CreatedById      | reference | [User]      | CreatedBy                                             |
| LastModifiedById | reference | [User]      | LastModifiedBy                                        |
| User__c          | reference | [User]      | <span style="background-color:yellow;">User__r</span> |

We could have here a **calculated** column called `fullName` with the following formula: `User__r.FirstName & ’ ’ & User__r.LastName`.

In that case, `fullName` will have information based on the table `Users` and not the `Orders`.

<Notice type="error">
  When extracting data those columns are very dangerous since **changes in the referenced table does not modify the `LastModifiedDate` from the main table**.
  In the example above, we would see a different `fullName` if `User.FirstName` is modified but the `Order` table will have the same `LastModifiedDate` as before, since the `Order` table hasn't been modified. This is dangerous for data extractions.
</Notice>

## 5. Query including external changes

| CreatedDate      | False      |                   | datetime  |                 |                                                                 |
