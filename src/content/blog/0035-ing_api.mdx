## 1. ING Developer

ING has a <FancyLink linkText="developer portal" url="https://developer.ing.com/openbanking/home"/> with instructions
for accessing their APIs.

There are 2 API types:

* <FancyLink linkText="Openbanking" url="https://developer.ing.com/openbanking/get-started/openbanking"/>: open for anyone to access
* <FancyLink linkText="PSD2" url="https://developer.ing.com/openbanking/get-started/psd2"/>: for accessing those ones you need an eIDAS certificate.

<Notice type="info">
  eIDAS certificates can only be optained by organizations, not by individuals like you or me
</Notice>

This post focus on the **Open Banking** API.

<Notice type="error">
  **Disclaimer:** At the time of writting it is not possible to use "Open Banking" for personal use.
  **Only accredited institutions will get the requeried credentials.**
  I discovered after doing all the work and I'm sharing it in case anyone wants to try it and/or in case individuals can use it in the future.
</Notice>

## 2. The Open Banking API

At the moment of writting of this post there is not a lot that you can do with this API.
Those are the 2 APIs you can use:

* <FancyLink linkText="OAuth 2.0" url="https://developer.ing.com/api-marketplace/marketplace/2d00fd5f-88cd-4416-bbca-f309ebb03bfe/reference?endpoint=0"/>: Allows to authenticate and retrieve a token
* <FancyLink linkText="Showcase API" url="https://developer.ing.com/api-marketplace/marketplace/5f5106c4-3413-4b3c-890a-bb4cfa165dba/overview"/>: This allows you to query `/greetings/single` which is the equivalent of a `hello world`

As you can see right now it is not very useful.
When I started investigating I didn't realize that you couldn't retrieve your own data with the **Open Banking API**.
So I followed all their documentation and developed all the code until I realized that it was not useful at all.
But since I had all the code I thought it might be useful to share.

I also contacted their **support** and they told me they plan to allow users to access their account info with the **Open Banking API**.
But there is no ETA for that.


## 3. Open Banking API Sandbox

This part follows the <FancyLink linkText="Getting Started with Open Banking API" url="https://developer.ing.com/openbanking/get-started/openbanking"/>.

The first thing you need to do is to download the example certificates:

* example_client_signing.cer (you don't really need this one)
* example_client_signing.key
* example_client_tls.cer
* example_client_tls.key

And also:

* host: `https://api.sandbox.ing.com`
* client_id: `e77d776b-90af-4684-bebc-521e5b2614dd`

For requesting the token with the `OAuth 2.0 API` they provide a script.
However I wanted to have everything in python.

The first thing is to install `cryptodome` with

```sh
pip install pycryptodome
```

<Notice type="info" className="mt-6">
  All the code can be found in <FancyLink linkText="Villoro posts: ING API" url="https://github.com/villoro/villoro_posts/tree/master/0035-ing_api" dark="true"/>
</Notice>

Let's break down the script in parts

### 3.1. Digesting and signing

You need to calculate the `SHA256` of some parts.
That can be done with:

```python
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256

# to digest 'text'
digest = SHA256.new()
digest.update(text.encode())
```

From that we can create a function that does it and can also sign the digest with:

```python
sign_key = "certificates/example_client_signing.key" # Adapt path

def encode_sha256(text, sign=False):
    """ digest a text with SHA256 """

    digest = SHA256.new()
    digest.update(text.encode())

    if sign:
        # Get the signing key
        with open(sign_key, "r") as file:
            data = file.read()

        private_key = RSA.importKey(data)
        signer = PKCS1_v1_5.new(private_key)
        out = signer.sign(digest)

    else:
        out = digest.digest()

    return b64encode(out).decode()
```

And finally we need to encode it as a base64 string with:
```python
from base64 import b64encode

b64encode(out).decode()
```

### 3.2. Parameters

Now let's create the basic parameters:

```python
import uuid
from datetime import datetime

mdate = datetime.utcnow().strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S GMT")
digest = encode_sha256(body) # Without signing
req_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
```

And the headers:
```python
headers = {
    "Date": mdate,
    "Digest": f"SHA-256={digest}",
    "X-ING-ReqID": req_id,
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    "Accept": "application/json",
}
```

### 3.3. Getting the signature

In this step you need to encode with `SHA256` the composition of:
* endpoint
* date
* body digest
* req_id

After that you need to append some information.
All of that can be done with:

```python
def get_signature(method, endpoint, mdate, digest, req_id):

    text = [
        f"(request-target): {method.lower()} {endpoint}",
        f"date: {mdate}",
        f"digest: SHA-256={digest}",
        f"x-ing-reqid: {req_id}",
    ]

    signature_digest = encode_sha256("\n".join(text), True)

    signature = [
        f'keyId="{client_id}"',
        'algorithm="rsa-sha256"',
        'headers="(request-target) date digest x-ing-reqid"',
        f'signature="{signature_digest}"',
    ]

    return ",".join(signature)
```

### 3.4. Doing the request

Now we need to append the authorization as a header:

```python
signature = get_signature(method, endpoint, mdate, digest, req_id)
if token:
    headers.update({"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}", "Signature": signature})
else:
    headers.update({"Authorization": f"Signature {signature}"})
```

And finally we can do the request:

```python
tls_cert="certificates/example_client_tls.cer",
tls_key="certificates/example_client_tls.key",

result = requests.request(
    method.upper(),
    self.host + endpoint,
    headers=headers,
    data=body,
    cert=(tls_cert, tls_key),
)
```

### 3.5. Getting the token

This can be done with the code explained and using those params:

* endpoint: `/oauth2/token`
* method: `POST`
* body: `grant_type=client_credentials`


## 4. Creating your app

In this step you need to sign in to the <FancyLink linkText="ING developer portal" url="https://developer.ing.com/openbanking/auth/login"/>.

Then you need to create an app.

### 4.1. Generating your certificates

You need to generate:

* ing_http.key
* ing_http.key
* ing_tls.crt
* ing_tls.crt

You can generate the first 2 with:

```sh
# 1. Generate an RSA private key. The password of the private key can be entered during execution of the command, so it doesn't end up in the history of your shell.
openssl genrsa -out ing_http.key -passout stdin 2048
# 2. Generate the X.509 Certificate Signing Request
openssl req -sha256 -new -key ing_http.key -out ing_http.csr
# 3. Sign the X.509 certificate with your own private key
openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 -in ing_http.csr -signkey ing_http.key -out ing_http.crt
```

Then need to repeat the 3 steps but replacing `ing_http` by `ing_tls`.

### 4.2. Getting a token with your API

You need to follow the same as before but changing some params:

* host: `https://api.ing.com`
* client_id: You can get that from the web
* sign_key: `certificates/ing_http.key`
* tls_cert: `certificates/ing_tls.crt`
* tls_key: `certificates/ing_tls.key`

### 4.3. Doing a hello world

Once you have the open you can suscribe to <FancyLink linkText="Showcase API" url="https://developer.ing.com/api-marketplace/marketplace/5f5106c4-3413-4b3c-890a-bb4cfa165dba/overview"/>.
You will need to wait until your request is approved.

Once it is approved you can query the only endpoint to check that everything is working:

* method: `GET`
* endpoint: `/greetings/single`


## 5. Next steps

Now you can wait with me until they add more APIs under the Open Banking ðŸ˜¢
