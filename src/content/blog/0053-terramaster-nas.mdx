## 0. Motivation

After purchasing the <FancyLink linkText="Terramaster F2-424" url="https://amzn.to/40CRZqJ" company="amazon"/> NAS, I decided to document my setup process. This guide serves as both a personal reference in case I need to reinstall and a practical guide for others who might be setting up a similar NAS configuration.

## 1. About the hardware

For anyone considering a NAS, here’s a summary of my experience and the choices I made for my setup.

### 1.1. The NAS

Previously, I had a Synology D115J, but its CPU wasn’t quite powerful enough for my needs. I wanted a NAS capable of running multiple Docker containers, which required a more robust processor. After researching Synology and QNAP models, I found that their budget options were often limited by outdated CPUs.

That’s when I came across the Terramaster NAS lineup. Although I initially had reservations about Terramaster's Operating System (TOS), reviews suggested that it was straightforward to replace TOS with options like Unraid or TrueNAS if needed. Ultimately, I decided on a 2-bay NAS for simplicity, choosing fewer but larger disks for storage capacity. The <FancyLink linkText="Terramaster F2-424" url="https://amzn.to/40CRZqJ" company="amazon"/> offered the best balance of power and flexibility for my setup.

### 1.2. The Hard Drives

When selecting drives, I prioritized models rated for 24/7 operation, essential for NAS use. Initially, I purchased <FancyLink linkText="Seagate Exos X18 3.5 16TB" url="https://amzn.to/3O2h2vX" company="amazon"/> drives because they were cost-effective. However, the noise level turned out to be too disruptive, especially with the NAS housed in a cabinet near my living room. Fortunately, I was able to exchange them for <FancyLink linkText="Seagate IronWolf Pro 3.5 NAS 16TB" url="https://amzn.to/4eopD6G" company="amazon"/> drives (at an additional 90€ per drive). Although pricier, the IronWolf Pro drives are significantly quieter and better suited to my setup.

### 1.3. The UPS

To protect the NAS from potential power outages, I opted for a UPS with a USB connection, enabling automatic shutdown of the NAS during an outage. I chose the <FancyLink linkText="Master Power (UPS 650 VA - 360W)" url="https://amzn.to/3YDj7Dw" company="amazon"/> as a budget-friendly option, which is ideal for low-power devices like my NAS. This UPS provides just enough backup power to safely handle brief outages and help prevent data loss.

## 2. Initial Setup

For a detailed installation guide, you may want to consult the <FancyLink linkText="Terramaster Quickguide" url="https://support.terra-master.com/quickguide/" company="terramaster"/>. Here, I’ll highlight the steps that were most relevant for my setup.

### 2.1. Locating the NAS

To begin, you’ll need to locate the NAS on your network. With a Terramaster NAS, simply navigate to <FancyLink linkText="tnas.local" url="http://tnas.local" dark="true" company="default"/>. After a few clicks, you should see the NAS IP displayed. If that doesn’t work, you can use a network analysis app, such as <FancyLink linkText="Fing" url="https://www.fing.com"/>, to find the NAS IP.

### 2.2. Install Terramaster OS (TOS)

<Notice type="info">
  My goal was to install TOS on the SSD, allowing the HDDs to go into sleep mode when not in use, which reduces wear and noise.
</Notice>

To install TOS on the SSD:

1. Choose a **custom configuration** during the setup process.
2. Select all the SSDs you want to use for the installation.
3. Proceed with the **Online Install** option.

This process will partition each selected SSD to install the OS. While the installation completes, it’s a good time to review your network setup for optimal connectivity.

## 3. Network Configuration

Many users opt to use a secondary router rather than the one provided by their Internet Service Provider (ISP). ISP-provided routers often have limited features and performance. However, adding a secondary router can introduce double NAT, which can cause connectivity issues. You can learn more about double NAT and its effects in this <FancyLink linkText="guide" url="https://medium.com/@gmanual/double-nat-explained-and-possible-solutions-8b41b6c651bd" dark="true"/>.

To resolve double NAT, you have two main options:
1. Set the ISP router to **bridge mode**.
2. **Create a DMZ** on the ISP router for the secondary router.

Since I couldn’t enable bridge mode on my ISP router, I opted for the DMZ setup. Below are the steps that worked for me.

<Notice type="warning">
  Note: These steps may vary depending on your router models and network configuration. Refer to your router’s manual for model-specific instructions.
</Notice>

### 3.1. Reserve an IP for you secondary router

To set up a DMZ, the first step is to assign a static IP to your secondary router:

1. Locate the **MAC address** of your secondary router.
2. Access your **ISP router’s configuration** page.
2. In the DHCP settings, **create a DHCP binding** for the secondary router, preferably using its current IP for simplicity.

### 3.2. DMZ

Once the IP is reserved, follow these steps to set up the DMZ:

1. Go to the **ISP router’s configuration** page.
2. Locate the **DMZ settings**.
3. Enable the DMZ and assign it to the static IP of your secondary router.

## 4. Handling storage

Once TOS installation finishes you can create your superuser. Afterwards you are ready to set up the storege.

<Notice type="warning">
  You can use `letters`, `numbers` and `special characters` in your passwords. And at least it can be 64 characters long.
</Notice>

### 4.1. Creating a storage pool

The first thing you will need to decide is the `RAID` you want. Here I suggest:
* `TRAID` if you have different disk sizes in order to avoid wasted space
* `TRAID` if you plan on adding more disks later, since you won't need to recreate the volume
* A standard `RAID` (0, 1, 5 or 6) if you have same size disks and you won't add extra disks (so that it's compatible with other OS and it's easier to recover in case of failures.)

Regarding the storage formats you can go with `EX4` or `BTRFS`.
Honestly I'm no expert here, I chose `EX4` because I read it's more stable.
You can read more about it in <FancyLink linkText="BTRFS vs EX4 | Terramaster forum" url="https://forum.terra-master.com/en/viewtopic.php?t=1851#:~:text=Re%3A%20BTRFS%20vs%20EXT4,-Post%20by%20TMzethar&text=The%20ext4%20format%20will%20retain,stable%20in%20terms%20of%20stability" company="terramaster"/>.

<Notice type="info">
  HDDs will be noisy during the storage pool creation (RAID Synchronization), but noise will decrease during regular usage.
</Notice>

### 4.2. Hyper Cache

You can use one of the 2 M2 SSD slots for caching. That can speed up `reads`, `writes` or both (`balanced`). The choice will depend on the NAS usage.

### 4.3. Options for adding data

My model has two 2.5 Gbps ethernet ports which should give file transfers speeds of around 250–280 MB/s.
The alternative is to use the USB 3.1 Gen 1 with an external SSD.
That could offer higher speeds (~300–400 MB/s) but I think it's not worht it since you will first need to copy the data into the SSD and then out of it.

It's important to notice that depending of the RAID you chose, you might reach the HDD speed limit (~250 MB/s for the Seagate Ironwolf Pro I installed).

<Notice type="info">
  In general I suggest you load data into the NAS over ethernet as oposed to using a USB external drive.
</Notice>

## 5. Connecting locally (SSH)

When installing some apps it is very useful to be able to connect a terminaly directly to the NAS (`ssh`).

<Notice type="danger">
  Only do this if you are confortable with `ssh`!
</Notice>

1. Go to `Control Panel`
1. Inside the `Network Services` section select `Terminal & SNMP`
2. Allow SSH access with username and password
3. You should set a custom port for security reasons (defaults to `9222`)

Then with a terminal you can connect to the NAS with:

```sh
ssh [username]@[ip] -p [port]
```

You must replace:
* `[username]`. You must use the first user you created
* `[ip]`
* `[port]`  

<Notice type="warning">
  Once you are done setting up everything I suggest you disable `SSH` to minimize security risks.
</Notice>

## 6. Installing apps

In the `App Center` you can install apps either from the `Terramaster` or from the `Community`.

In my case I'll use:
* Plex
* qBittorrent
* Docker (`Docker Engine`, `Docker Manager` and `Portainer`)
* Tailscale (community app)

### 6.1. Plex

The configuration is quite straightforward. You will need to open the app and sign in into plex.
Afterwards you can create your libraries as usual.
I suggest putting the plex libraries inside the `Public` folder so that 

### 6.2. qBittorrent

When you install qBittorrent an `admin` user will be created with a password (`adminadmin`)

<Notice type="info">
  If you used the community app the password will be randomnly created. You can get it from the logs.
</Notice>

<Notice type="warning">
  The first thing you need to do is change the default password.
  You can do it at `Tools/Options/Web UI/Authentication`
</Notice>

Regarding downloads I prefer having them inside `public` (`/Volume1/public/Downloads`) folder so that every user can access them.

Finally I like adding a folder that is whatched for new torrents and to move the added ones and completed ones into subfolders.
You can set it up in `Tools/Options/Downloads` with:

* Monitored folder: `/Volume1/public/Torrents/`
* Copy `.torrent` files to: `/Volume1/public/Torrents/Added/`
* Copy `.torrent` files for finished downloads to: `/Volume1/public/Torrents/Downloaded/`

### 6.3. Tailscale

This is a community app. You can download it from <FancyLink linkText="Tailscale | TerraMaster Community Place" url="https://tmnascommunity.eu/download/tailscale/" dark="true" company="default"/>. To install it you need to upload the file to `App Center/Settings/Install application manually`.

In order to connect the NAS to your tailscale you will need to register.
First download the logs (`/<your_user>/MOD_CONFIG/Tailscale/Tailscale_start.log`).
There you will find the `login url` which should look like:

```plaintext
To authenticate, visit:

  https://login.tailscale.com/a/xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Once you have added it, it should appear in your admin console. Optinally you can change it's name to something like `nas`.

#### 6.3.1. Set the NAS as an exit node

Optionally you can set the NAS as an exit node.
You will need to SSH into the NAS.
If you do it with a computer where you have tailscale install and connect you can reference the machine name (`nas`) instead of the IP.

So you can SSH as we saw before
```sh
ssh [username]@nas -p [port]
```
Remember to replace `[username]` (you must use the first user you created) and `[port]`.

Then you can set the NAS as an exit node with:

```sh
tailscale set --advertise-exit-node
```

Finally you might also want to update it and enable auto updates to avoid security problems with:

```sh
tailscale update
tailscale set --auto-update
```

## 7. UPS

In order to protect the NAS from power outages I think it is really important to connect it to a UPS.
Some models can be connected by USB so that whenever there is a power outage the NAS is notified and can be automatically turned off.

To set this up, go to `Control Panel/Hardware & Power` and click `enable USB support`.
