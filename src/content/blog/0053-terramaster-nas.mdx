## 1. NAS Setup and Storage Configuration

ex4 vs btrfs

* Initial Setup: Choose between default and custom installations; selecting hard drives for system files is common.
* M.2 SSDs for Caching: You can use read, write, or balanced cache. Balanced caching gives a mix of read and write performance, but if you're focused on media streaming (e.g., Plex), read cache is recommended.
* RAID Synchronization: HDDs may be noisy during the RAID synchronization process, but noise will decrease during regular usage.
* Noise Reduction: Add acoustic foam, anti-vibration pads, and rubber seals to reduce noise if placing the NAS in a cabinet. Ensure proper ventilation.

## 2. Network Configuration and Performance

* Transfer Files Over 2.5 Gbps Ethernet: If supported, use 2.5 Gbps Ethernet for faster file transfers (around 250–280 MB/s). USB 3.1 Gen 1 with an external SSD could offer higher speeds (~300–400 MB/s) for local transfers.
* Gigabit Ethernet: Limited to 125 MB/s, so it won’t fully utilize HDD speeds (~249 MB/s max for Seagate Exos X18).
* VPN Setup: Use WireGuard with Docker if not natively supported by TOS. Forward port 51820/UDP for external access.

## 3. Plex Setup and Troubleshooting

* Plex Claim Issues: If you're having trouble claiming the Plex server, use the manual token method via https://plex.tv/claim or access the NAS at http://127.0.0.1:32400/web to claim it directly from the local machine.

## 4. qBittorrent Setup

* qBittorrent App from Terramaster Community:
    * Set up public/Torrents as the monitored folder for new torrents.
    * Configure public/Downloads as the destination for completed downloads in the qBittorrent Web UI.

## 5. Firewall rules
