  [TOC]

  ## 1. What is pre-commit

  With pre-commit you can automate some repetitive tasks before doing a `commit` on a **git** repository.
  It is useful for identifying simple issues before submission to code review.

  For example with **pre-commit** you can point out issues in code such as missing semicolons, trailing whitespace, and debug statements.

  **Pre-commit** can work with **any development language** even though is a python package.

  ## 2. Installation

  To install you can simply run:

  ```sh
  pip install pre-commit
  ```

  ## 3. Configuration

  Once you have the package installed you need the file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with the hooks you need.

  As an example you can use:

  <div class="input">
    .pre-commit-config.yaml
  </div>
  ```yaml
  repos:
  -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
      rev: v2.3.0
      hooks:
      -   id: check-yaml
      -   id: end-of-file-fixer
      -   id: trailing-whitespace
  -   repo: https://github.com/psf/black
      rev: 19.3b0
      hooks:
      -   id: black
  ```

  Once you are in a repository that has the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file you can install the hooks with:

  ```sh
  pre-commit install
  ```

  ## 4. Usage

  By default `pre-commit` will run only on the stagged files. You can check all the files the first time you install it with:

  ```sh
  pre-commit run --all-files
  ```

  After that each time you try to do a commit `pre-commit` will run all hooks and will prevent you from commiting simple issues.

  ## 5. Updating hooks

  You can update all `pre-commit` hooks with:

  ```sh
  pre-commit autoupdate
  ```

  ## 6. Continuous integration (CI)

  It is a good idea to run `pre-commit` on your CI to check that nobody is pushing code with errors.

  You can do it with:

  ```sh
  pre-commit run --all-files
  ```

  If you want to only run it on the files that have changed just do:

  ```sh
  pre-commit run --from-ref origin.HEAD --to-ref HEAD
  ```

  ## 7. Useful hooks

  There are some default hooks defined [here](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks).

  Some that I find really useful are:

  * check-merge-conflict
  * check-json
  * check-toml
  * check-yaml
  * no-commit-to-branch

  You can add them with the following code:

  <div class="input">
    .pre-commit-config.yaml
  </div>
  ```yaml
  repos:
  -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
      rev: v2.3.0
      hooks:
      -   id: check-merge-conflict
      -   id: check-json
      -   id: check-toml
      -   id: check-yaml
      -   id: no-commit-to-branch
  ```
