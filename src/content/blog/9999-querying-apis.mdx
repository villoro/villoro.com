## 0. Building a Robust Python API Client

Extracting large datasets from APIs reliably can be tricky — timeouts, rate limits, and memory issues are common pitfalls. A well‑designed API client can make data extraction both safer and more efficient.

This post covers **practical tips** for building resilient API clients in Python, with code examples you can adapt. The focus is on reliability, separation of concerns, and handling edge cases.

## 1. Encapsulate in a Class

Encapsulate all API logic inside a client class. This keeps configuration and state in one place and avoids global variables.

```python
class QlikClient:
    def __init__(self, timeout_s=180, page_size=100, max_calls=900, debug=False):
        self.timeout_s = timeout_s
        self.page_size = page_size
        self.max_calls = max_calls
        self.debug = debug
        self.session = requests.Session()

    def _get(self, url=None, params=None, headers=None, timeout=None):
        """Do one query to a URL."""
        pass

    def query_all(self, endpoint, params=None):
        """Query until all items are retrieved."""
        pass
```

<Notice type="info" className="mt-6">
  Using a class makes it easy to reuse settings and ensures a single responsibility: the client only handles API calls.
</Notice>

## 2. Reuse the Session

Use a `requests.Session` to reuse TCP connections and reduce latency.

```python
# Inside __init__
self.session = requests.Session()

# Later
response = self.session.get(url, params=params, timeout=timeout)
```

This avoids reconnecting on each call, which can **significantly improve performance** ([requests docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects)).

<Notice type="warning">
  Always close the session when done (`self.session.close()`) or implement `__enter__`/`__exit__` for context manager support.
</Notice>

## 3. Log Intent

Log what the client is doing, especially the URL and parameters.

```python
from prefect import get_run_logger

def _get(self, url=None, params=None, headers=None, timeout=None):
    logger = get_run_logger()
    params = params or {}
    headers = headers or {}
    timeout = timeout or self.timeout_s

    logger.info(f"Querying API with {url=} ({params=}, {timeout=})")
    response = self.session.get(url, headers=headers, params=params, timeout=timeout)

    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
```

<Notice type="warning" className="mt-6">
  Be careful not to log sensitive info like API keys or tokens. Mask or omit them.
</Notice>

## 4. Timeouts

Always set timeouts to avoid hanging requests.

```python
response = self.session.get(
    url, headers=headers, params=params, timeout=(5, 30)
)
```

Here we use a **connect timeout of 5s** and a **read timeout of 30s**. See [requests timeout docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#timeouts).

<Notice type="info">
  Choose sensible defaults. For APIs, a few seconds connect timeout and a higher read timeout is typical.
</Notice>

## 5. Raise for Errors

Never ignore HTTP errors. Use `raise_for_status()` for unknown responses.

```python
response = self.session.get(url, params=params, timeout=self.timeout_s)

if response.status_code == 204:  # No content, stop gracefully
    return []

if response.status_code == 429:
    # Too many requests → could retry with backoff
    handle_rate_limit()

response.raise_for_status()  # Raise for all other errors
```

<Notice type="warning" className="mt-6">
  Fail fast on unexpected errors — silent failures can corrupt downstream data.
</Notice>

## 6. Handle Pagination with for/else

Prevent infinite loops by limiting max pages.

```python
class MaxApiCallsExceeded(Exception):
    pass

def query_all(self, url, params=None):
    logger = get_run_logger()
    params = params or {}

    next_url = None
    results = []
    for i in range(1, self.max_calls + 1):
        response = self._get(url=next_url or url, params=params)

        data = response.get("data") or []
        results += data
        next_url = response.get("next")

        prefix = f"[Page {i}/{self.max_calls}]"
        logger.info(f"{prefix} Retrieved {len(data)} rows (total={len(results)})")

        if not next_url:
            logger.info(f"{prefix} No next cursor → stopping")
            break
    else:
        raise MaxApiCallsExceeded(f"{self.max_calls} reached when querying {url}")

    return results
```

<Notice type="info" className="mt-6">
  Python’s `for/else` lets you raise an error if the loop never breaks — a safeguard against infinite pagination.
</Notice>

## 7. Separate Concerns

The client should **only handle API calls** — not data processing.

<Notice type="warning">
  Don’t mix Pandas/Spark into your client. Keep it lightweight and focused. Transformation belongs downstream.
</Notice>

## 8. Export in Batches

For large datasets, don’t keep everything in memory. Process or export in chunks.

```python
results = []
for page in client.query_all(endpoint):
    process_page(page)
    if len(results) > 10_000:
        export_results(results)
        results = []
```

See [Requests streaming docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#streaming-requests) for large payloads.

## 9. Backoff for Transient Failures

Use exponential backoff for rate limits or known errors.

```python
import backoff

class RateLimitError(Exception):
    pass

@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo, RateLimitError, max_tries=5)
def _query_data(self, url, params):
    response = self.session.get(url, params=params)

    if response.status_code == 429:
        raise RateLimitError("Hit rate limit")

    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
```

<Notice type="info">
  Backoff reduces stress on APIs and increases resilience. See [backoff docs](https://pypi.org/project/backoff/).
</Notice>

## 10. Avoid Self‑Recursion

Don’t retry by recursively calling the same function. Use loops or backoff instead.

<Notice type="warning">
  Recursive retries can hit Python’s recursion limit (\~1000) and crash the program.
</Notice>

## 11. Export Partial Results on Failure

Always save what you have if extraction fails mid‑way.

```python
results = []
try:
    for i in range(self.max_calls):
        results += query_api()
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected {e=}")
    if results:
        logger.info(f"Exporting {len(results)} results after failure")
        export_results(results)
    raise  # Relaunches the exception
```

## 12. Respect Rate Limits

Don’t just react to 429s — proactively throttle requests.

```python
import time

MAX_CALLS_PER_MIN = 100
INTERVAL = 60 / MAX_CALLS_PER_MIN

for url in urls:
    call_api(url)
    time.sleep(INTERVAL)
```

Many APIs return headers like `X-RateLimit-Remaining`. Check docs, e.g. [GitHub API rate limits](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting).

## 13. Stream or Yield Data

For very large responses, yield results instead of accumulating.

```python
def query_all(self, url, params=None):
    next_url = url

    for i in range(1, self.max_calls + 1):
        response = self._get(url=next_url, params=params)
        yield response.get("data", [])

        if not (next_url := response.get("next")):
            break
```

<Notice type="info">
  Streaming reduces memory usage. See [requests streaming](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#streaming-requests).
</Notice>

## 14. Clean Up Resources

Support context managers so the session is always closed.

```python
class QlikClient:
    def __enter__(self):
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.session.close()
```

Usage:

```python
with QlikClient() as client:
    data = client.query_all("/endpoint")
```

<Notice type="info">
  If you are running your code on ephemeral infrastructure, you can skip this since your machine is terminated after running the extractiong.
</Notice>

## Conclusion

These practices help you build API clients that are **reliable, efficient, and safe**:

* Encapsulate logic in a class
* Reuse sessions for performance
* Log, set timeouts, and raise errors properly
* Handle pagination safely
* Keep concerns separate and export in batches
* Add resilience with backoff and rate limit handling
* Stream data, close resources, and save partial results

By combining these, you can extract data from APIs at scale without nasty surprises.
