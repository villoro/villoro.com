## 0. Motivation

In this guide, I'll walk you through installing and configuring MEGASync on a TerraMaster NAS using Docker. This setup is particularly useful because **TOS CloudSync doesn't support MEGA**, leaving users with limited options for seamless synchronization with MEGA cloud storage. Using Docker, you can overcome this limitation and enjoy a fully functional sync setup.

If you're just starting with your TerraMaster NAS, I recommend checking out my previous post <FancyLink linkText="Setting Up and Optimizing a Terramaster NAS" url="https://villoro.com/blog/setting-up-terramaster-nas/" dark="true"/>, where I cover the basics to get your device up and running. Once your NAS is set up, this guide will help you extend its functionality with MEGASync.

## 1. About TOS Paths

TerraMaster's TOS handles user directories in a specific way that can sometimes cause confusion or issues with Docker containers. While user folders are displayed in TOS under `/home/<username>`, these directories are actually mapped internally to `/Volume1/User/<username>`. This discrepancy can lead to problems with Docker containers, particularly when they require consistent and predictable file paths.

### 1.1. Proposed Directory Structure for MEGASync

Based on conventions used by other apps like **Tailscale**, I recommend the following paths for MEGASync:

* **Configuration Files**: `/home/<admin_username>/MOD_CONFIG/Mega/<username>`. This path organizes MEGASync configurations under a dedicated MOD_CONFIG folder, keeping the structure clean and consistent with other apps.

* **Synced Data**: `/home/<username>`. Using the root directory of the target user ensures straightforward access and avoids conflicts with other applications.

## 2. Run the MEGASync Docker Container

You can set up MEGASync either via the terminal or by using Portainer. Choose the option that works best for you.

Before proceeding please notice:

<Notice type="warning">
  **Default Path Issues:** The default configuration path for MEGASync includes spaces (`/megasync/.local/share/data/Mega Limited/MEGAsync`), which can cause parsing and permission problems. To avoid this, we set the `DATA_DIR` environment variable to `/megasync/config`.
</Notice>

<Notice type="warning" classname="mt-6">
  **Ports:** It is recommeneded you use a custom port for security reasons. As an example I set it to 8081, but I suggest you use something different.
</Notice>

You can use the following command to see which ports are free to use:

```bash
netstat -tuln | grep LISTEN
```

### 2.1. Option 1: Using the Terminal

Run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=megasync-<username> \
  -p 8081:8080 \
  --env 'DATA_DIR=/megasync/config' \
  --env 'CUSTOM_RES_W=1280' \
  --env 'CUSTOM_RES_H=720' \
  --volume "/home/<admin_username>/MOD_CONFIG/Mega/<username>:/megasync/config" \
  --volume "/home/<username>:/sync-data" \
  --restart=always \
  ich777/megasync
```

<Notice type="warning">
  You must replace `<admin_username>` and `<username>`.
</Notice>

### 2.2. Option 2: Using Portainer

Use the following configuration:

```yaml
Name: megasync-villoro
Image: ich777/megasync:latest
Network ports configuration:
  Manual network port publishing:
    host: 8081 # Change it
    container: 8080
Advanced container settings:
  Volumes:
    - container: /megasync/config
      type: bind
      host: /home/<admin_username>/MOD_CONFIG/Mega/villoro
    - container: /sync-data
      type: bind
      host: /home/villoro
  Env:
    - name: CUSTOM_RES_W
      value: 1280
    - name: CUSTOM_RES_H
      value: 720
    - name: DATA_DIR
      value: /megasync/config
Restart Policy: Always
```

After entering all the configuration in Portainer, click `Deploy the container`.

## 3. Access the MEGASync Web Interface

Once the container is running, access the MEGASync interface by opening your browser and navigating to:

```plaintext
http://<NAS_IP>:8081
```
<Notice type="warning">
  Replace `<NAS_IP>` with your NASâ€™s IP address. Also make sure to use the port you decided.
</Notice>

Once there you will see a nice UI similar to what you would see on a desktop computer with mega installed:

![Pipeline DAG example](../../images/posts/2024/0053-megasync-config.jpg)

In that window, log in to your MEGA account and set up synchronization.

<Notice type="warning">
  **Local Folder Setup**: Always choose `/sync-data` (or a subdirectory) for the **local folder** during synchronization setup to ensure proper syncing with the host.
</Notice>

Once you are done, you can always access the configuration by using the `Mega` icon on the "task bar":

## 4. Verify the Setup

- Monitor the container logs to ensure there are no errors:
  ```bash
  docker logs megasync
  ```

- Test synchronization by adding files to `/home/<username>` and confirming they appear in your MEGA account (and vice versa).

## 5. Adding Multiple Users

This setup is designed to work for multiple users. To sync another user, simply repeat the steps to run the Docker container. Use another `user_name` with the new username in all relevant paths and container names. For example:

- Configuration Path: `/home/<admin_username>/MOD_CONFIG/Mega/<new_username>`
- Sync Data Path: `/home/<new_username>`
- Container Name: `megasync-<new_username>`
- Port: Use a different host port (e.g., `8082:8080`) to avoid conflicts.

By doing so, each user will have their own isolated MEGAsync instance.

## 6. Troubleshooting

### 6.1. Permission Denied Errors

I had a lot of problems with this. The issue was that I was not correctly setting up the volumns and it was unable to work on the path I was setting.

### 6.2. Logs Indicate Missing Commands
Errors like `xrdb: command not found` are harmless and can be ignored.

### 6.3. Access Issues

Ensure the container is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

Verify the port mapping matches your setup.
