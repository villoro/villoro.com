## 0. Motivation

Amazon S3 is a powerful, scalable storage solution integral to many workflows. However, storage costs can quickly accumulate, especially when managing large datasets. After migrating some of our jobs from EMR to ECS, S3 storage emerged as our largest expense.

By analyzing our storage usage and implementing targeted strategies, we successfully reduced our S3 costs to one-third, as illustrated in the plot below.

<canvas id="plot-s3-costs" style="width:100%;height:300px;"></canvas>

<Notice type="success" className="mt-6">
  This guide outlines how to export an S3 Inventory and implement Lifecycle Policies to track and optimize your storage expenses effectively.
</Notice>

## 1. Categorizing S3 Costs

### 1.1 Discover S3 Costs with Cost Explorer

The first step is to examine your AWS costs by service using the **Cost Explorer**. This allows you to identify which service to target for cost reduction. In our case, after optimizing EMR costs, S3 became the next clear objective:

<div class="border-2 rounded-md">
  ![AWS Monthly Costs by Service](../../images/posts/2025/9999-aws-costs-by-service.png)
</div>

<Notice type="warning" className="mt-6">
  Focus on reducing costs for the AWS service with the largest expense. Target S3 only if it’s the primary cost driver.
</Notice>

Once you’ve identified S3 as your focus, analyze your S3 expenses by usage type:

<div class="border-2 rounded-md">
  ![S3 Daily Costs by Usage Type](../../images/posts/2025/9999-s3-costs-by-usage-type.png)
</div>

In our case, most costs stemmed from storage. However, in some organizations, high request costs may dominate, often due to numerous small files in a data lake.

</Notice>

### 1.2 Create an S3 Inventory Configuration

**S3 Inventory** is a feature in Amazon S3 that generates scheduled reports containing a comprehensive list of objects in a bucket, along with their metadata. This helps you analyze and manage storage efficiently.

#### 1.2.1. Steps to Set Up S3 Inventory:

1. **Access the S3 Console:**
   Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.

2. **Select Your Bucket:**
   Choose the bucket for which you want to create an inventory report.

3. **Go to Management:**
   In the bucket’s dashboard, select the **Management** tab and scroll down to the **Inventory** section.

4. **Create Inventory Configuration:**
   * Click **Create Inventory Configuration**.
   * Provide a unique name for your inventory.
   * Specify the **destination bucket** where the inventory report will be delivered.

5. **Select Report Content:**
   * Choose the **frequency** of the report: Daily or Weekly.
   * Select the **file format**. For large datasets, export it as `parquet` for optimized storage and processing.
   * Specify the **fields** to include. At a minimum, include object `size`, `storage class`, and `last modified` date.

6. **Review and Save:**
   - Review your configuration.
   - Save it by clicking **Create**.

#### 1.2.2. Notes on Destination Path:

The destination path will include additional folders automatically. For example, if your destination path is `s3://villoro/s3_inventory` for a bucket named `villoro` and inventory name `villoro_inventory`, the final path will be `s3://villoro/s3_inventory/villoro/villoro_inventory/`.

<Notice type="info">
  The first report will be available within 48 hours, and subsequent reports will be generated based on the frequency you selected.
</Notice>

### 1.3 Accessing the S3 Inventory

The S3 Inventory follows a unique structure. Reports are stored at `destination_path/bucket_name/inventory_name/`. The structure includes:

- **Timestamp Folders:** Contain a `manifest.json` listing the `parquet` files for that extraction.
- **Data Folder:** Contains the data files from all exports.
- **Hive Folder:** Includes symlinks to the timestamped folders for easier querying.

#### 1.3.1. Example Structure:

```plaintext
- s3://villoro/s3_inventory/villoro/villoro_inventory/
  ├── 2025-01-09T01-00Z/
  │   ├── manifest.json
  │   └── manifest.checksum
  ├── 2025-01-12T01-00Z/
  │   ├── manifest.json
  │   └── manifest.checksum
  ├── data/
  │   ├── 469e11b1-730b-487b-9110-e0fac5cb4237.parquet
  │   ├── ...
  │   └── 91ee5bf8-c053-4993-b698-ba07009b9060.parquet

      │   └──symlink.txt
      └── dt=2025-01-12-01-00/
          └──symlink.txt
```

#### 1.3.2. Example Manifest File:

```json
{
  "sourceBucket" : "villoro",
  "destinationBucket" : "arn:aws:s3:::villoro",
  "version" : "2016-11-30",
  "creationTimestamp" : "1736384401000",
  "fileFormat" : "Parquet",
  "fileSchema" : "message s3.inventory {  required binary bucket (STRING);  required binary key (STRING);}",
  "files" : [ {
    "key" : "s3_inventory/villoro/villoro_inventory/data/469e11b1-730b-487b-9110-e0fac5cb4237.parquet",
    "size" : 120112,
    "MD5checksum" : "f0731733165f367e93fa4a51ecc28edb"
  } ]
}
```

## 2. Extracting data from the inventory

We want to create a standard iceberg table given the non conventional folder structure of the inventory.

### 2.1. Creating a S3 Inventory table

The main idea is to read each manifest to know which parquet files correspond to each extraction. Then read those files and export it in a table. Then reapeat it for each inventory. Since we will be exporting all data, I think it's also a good idea to remove the source data.

This can be done with:

```python
import json
from datetime import datetime

import awswrangler as wr
import pandas as pd
from prefect import flow
from prefect import task
from prefect import get_run_logger

from ecs_northius.common import glue

BUCKET_DE = "nt-data-engineering-eu-west-1-742407267173-pro"

PREFIX_INVENOTRY = "s3_inventory/{bucket}/{inventory}"
PATH_INVENTORY = f"s3://{BUCKET_DE}/{PREFIX_INVENOTRY}"

INVENTORIES = {
    "de_inventory": BUCKET_DE,
    "bronze_inventory": "ct-bronze-eu-west-1-742407267173-pro",

    logger = get_run_logger()
    uri = PATH_INVENTORY.format(inventory=inventory, bucket=bucket)
    logger.info(f"Reading files in {uri=}")

    return wr.s3.list_objects(uri)

    manifest = S3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=filename)["Body"].read()

    logger.debug("Parsing manifest")
    return json.loads(manifest)["files"]


def read_and_export_data(inventory, bucket, data_files, reported_at):
    logger = get_run_logger()

    dfs = []
    logger.info(f"Reading {len(data_files)} files for {inventory=}")
    for file in data_files:
        # The replace is to fix an error in config
        key = file["key"].replace(f"{bucket}/{bucket}", bucket)

        uri = f"s3://{BUCKET_DE}/{key}"
        logger.debug(f"Reading parquet {uri=}")
        dfs.append(wr.s3.read_parquet(uri))

    df = pd.concat(dfs)
    df["bucket"] = bucket
    df["reported_at"] = reported_at

    glue.write_iceberg(df, DATABASE, TABLE) # This uses `wr.athena.to_iceberg`

def get_bucket_and_prefix(s3_path):
    if not s3_path.startswith("s3://"):
        raise ValueError("Invalid S3 path. Path must start with 's3://'.")

    # Remove 's3://' and split the remaining path
    path_parts = s3_path[5:].split("/", 1)

    # Bucket is the first part, prefix is the remaining
    bucket = path_parts[0]
    prefix = path_parts[1] if len(path_parts) > 1 else ""

    return bucket, prefix

def delete_all_files(all_files):
    logger = get_run_logger()

    for file in all_files:
        bucket, prefix = get_bucket_and_prefix(file)
        logger.debug(f"Removing {file=}")
        S3.delete_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=prefix)


def export_one_inventory(inventory, bucket, delete_files):
    logger = get_run_logger()

    all_files = get_all_files(inventory, bucket)

    manifest_files = sorted([x for x in all_files if x.endswith("manifest.json")])
    if len(manifest_files) == 0:
        logger.warning(f"There are no manifests files for {inventory=}")
        return False

    for manifest_file in manifest_files:
        reported_at = get_ts_from_manifest_path(manifest_file)
        data_files = get_data_files_from_manifest(manifest_file)
        read_and_export_data(inventory, bucket, data_files, reported_at)

    if delete_files:
        logger.info(f"Deleting {len(all_files)} files")
        delete_all_files(all_files)

    return True


@flow(name="export_inventory")
def export_all_inventories(flow_name="export_inventory", delete_files=False):
    logger = get_run_logger()

    for i, (inventory, bucket) in enumerate(INVENTORIES.items()):
        percent = f"{i + 1}/{len(INVENTORIES)}"
        logger.info(f"[Inventory {percent}] Processing {inventory=}'")
        name = f"export_inventory.{inventory}__{percent}"
        task(name=name)(export_one_inventory)(inventory, bucket, delete_files)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    export_all_inventories()

```

### 2.2. Cleaning the data with DBT

Here you have the 4 different models I used to model the inventory:

1. `base_metadata__s3_inventory.sql`: Base model for renamings and castings
2. `clean_metadata__s3_inventory.sql`: Keeps only the last report (optional) and ensures there are no duplicates
3. `int_metadata__s3_inventory.sql`: I used this model to tag different paths so that's easier to extract insights
4. `stg_metadata__s3_inventory.sql`: Used only for removing temporal columns by selecting the final columns
5. `stg_metadata__s3_inventory.sql`: Documentation for the stg model

You can see the code for each model by clicking each file:

### 2.3. Analyzing the inventory

Once you have a proper table with the inventory, it's up to you how to analyze it. In our case we did multiple things:
1. Analyze different categories
2. Explore the different folders for the top categories
3. Compare `bronze` and `silver` layers for the same entities

With that we discovered a couple of things:
1. We were not efectively deleting files in our biggest bucket
2. In some `bronze` tables we were only appending without any efective deletion

The first problem we solved it with a `S3 Lifecycle Policy` (details in the next section). The second one is out of the scope of this post.

## 3. Implement S3 Lifecycle Policies

S3 Lifecycle Policies can automatically manage your objects to reduce costs. For example, you can configure policies to transition objects to cheaper storage classes or delete non-current versions of objects. Here’s how to set them up:

1. **Navigate to Lifecycle Rules:**
   * In the S3 console, go to the **Management** tab of your bucket.
   * Scroll to the **Lifecycle Rules** section and click **Create Lifecycle Rule**.

2. **Define the Rule Scope:**
   * Provide a name for the rule.
   * Specify whether the rule applies to the entire bucket or to a subset of objects (e.g., objects with a specific prefix or tag).

3. **Configure Actions:**
   * **Transition Actions:** Move objects to cheaper storage classes like S3 Standard-IA, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, or S3 Deep Archive after a specified number of days.
   * **Expiration Actions:** Set rules to delete objects after a certain number of days.
   * **Non-Current Version Expiration:** Automatically delete older versions of objects to save storage space.

4. **Review and Save:**
   * Review your configuration.
   * Save the rule by clicking **Create Rule**.

<Notice type="info">
  Non-current version expiration is especially useful for buckets with versioning enabled to minimize storage costs.
</Notice>

By combining S3 Inventory with Lifecycle Policies, you can effectively analyze and manage your storage, ensuring optimal cost efficiency. This approach not only provides visibility into your data but also automates actions to keep your storage expenses under control.
