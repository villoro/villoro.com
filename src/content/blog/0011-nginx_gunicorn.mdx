  In order to serve a python web app hosted on a server there are some tools that you need to install and set up.

  ## Table of Contents

  [TOC]

  ## 1. Basic schema
  First of all you will need a Linux machine. I'd suggest you use an **AWS EC2** instance. You can see [here](https://villoro.com/post/aws_ec2.html) how to create one.

  There are three main components needed for serving a python app:

  1. Web server
  2. WSGI
  3. Python app
  4. Supervisor

  ### 1.1 Web server
  This component will handle the requests and among other things it will deal with static files (images, css, js...). In this post we are going to use [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) since it is more commonly used for python. Another popular option is [apache](https://httpd.apache.org/).

  ### 1.2. WSGI
  Web servers cannot communicate directly with python apps so you need a Web Server Gateway Interface ([WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what.html)).
  In this case we will use [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) because it is a simple solution. Another common choice would be [uwsgi](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

  ### 1.3. Python App
  The idea of this post is to set up `nginx` and `gunicorn`. To test them you can create a very simple app using [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). You can do the same with [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) or [dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) apps.

  ### 1.4. Supervisor
  [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) is a system that allows users to monitor and control processes. This will make sure to restart the gunicorn process if it anything goes wrong. Without it you should do it yourself.

  > You can read more about why a web server and wsgi [here](https://serverfault.com/questions/331256/why-do-i-need-nginx-and-something-like-gunicorn).

  ## 2. Installation
  First you should create the flask app and test it. After you will install and configure both wsgi and supervisor in order to have a service to serve the app. Finally you will configure nginx to serve the content to the web. 

  ### 2.1. Python app
   First let's create the `index.py` with the app:

  ```sh
  # Create html folder if neeeded
  mkdir /var/www/html
  cd /var/www/html

  # Install requirements
  pip3 install flask

  # Create index.py with the app
  nano /var/www/html/index.py
  ```

  And paste the following code:

  <div class="input">
    /var/www/html/index.py
  </div>
  ```python
  from flask import Flask

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route('/')
  def index():
      return "Hello World"

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run(debug=True)
  ```

  You can try it by running:
  ```sh
  python3 index.py
  ```

  You can now view it by going at XX.XXX.XXX.XXX:PORT (Use your EC2 IP and the port).

  > Default flask port is **5000**. To try it you need to open the port.

  #### 2.1.1. Open EC2 ports (optional)
  If you are using and **AWS EC2** it is possible that you don't have the port 80 opened. You can do it with:

  1. Go to AWS console and then to the EC2 page. Use the sidebar to go to `NETWORK & SECURITY/Security Groups`.
  2. Find the security group of your EC2 instance and edit the **Inbound** rules.
  3. Add `Custom TCP Rule` with port `5000` (or the one you used).
  4. If you are opening a port for testing, remeber to close it back when you are done.

  ### 2.2. WSGI
  
  Install gunicorn with:

  ```sh
  pip3 install gunicorn
  ```

  ### 2.3 Install supervisor

  ```sh
  sudo apt install supervisor -y
  ```
  
  You will create an config file for your project, for example `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/flask_test.conf`:

  ```sh
  sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/flask_test.conf
  ```

  And write the following configuration:

  <div class="input">
    /etc/supervisor/conf.d/flask_test.conf
  </div>
  ```
  [program:flask_test]
  command = gunicorn index:app -b localhost:8000
  directory = /var/www/html/
  autostart = true
  autorestart = true
  ```

  > `index` refers to the python file. `app` is the name of the flask app that is inside this file.

  Then start supervisor:

  ```sh
  sudo supervisorctl reread
  sudo service supervisor restart

  # Check the result
  sudo supervisorctl status
  ```
  
  ### 2.4. Web server

  #### 2.4.1. Install and test nginx

  To install nginx run:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt install nginx -y
  ```

  You can now view if nginx is serving content by going at XX.XXX.XXX.XXX (Use your EC2 IP). You will see the `nginx` default landing page:

  <div class="w3-center">
    <img src="/static/images/posts/welcome_nginx.png" alt="welcome_nginx" class="w3-image w3-padding-16 w3-border" style="max-height: 300px;"/>
  </div>

  You will see the `nginx` default landing page:
  > You will need the port **80** opened

  #### 2.4.2 Configure nginx

  You should add a config file for your app (`flask_test` for example) inside the nginx `sites-available` folder. You should delete the `default` config file.

  ```sh
  sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
  sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/flask_test
  ```

  And write the following configuration:

  <div class="input">
    /etc/nginx/sites-available/flask_test
  </div>
  ```text
  server {
      listen 80 flask_server;

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
      }
  }
  ```

  > `8000` should match the port defined at supervisor and `80` will the port that you opened to test nginx.

  Now you need a symlink in `sites-enabled` that points to the file you created before:

  ```sh
  sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
  sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/flask_test /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
  ```

  And now you can start nginx:

  ```sh
  sudo nginx -t
  sudo service nginx restart
  ```

  You can now go to XX.XXX.XXX.XXX and you should see the flask app `Hello World` message.

  > If everything is working remeber to close the ports that you opened only for testing.

  ## 3. Next steps

  ### 3.1. Configure nginx

  The nginx configuration you used is really simple. For example you can set nginx to serve static files directly instead of passing through the flask app by:

  <div class="input">
    /etc/nginx/sites-available/flask_test
  </div>
  ```text
  server {
      listen 80 flask_server;

      location /static/ {
          root /var/www/html/;
      }

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
      }
  }
  ```

  ### 3.2. SSL certificate

  I strongly suggest you set up a SSL certificate for apps that are in production. You can learn how with this [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04).

  While working on this post I set this app for my first time. It is normal to encounter difficultes but I was able to sort it out, you can do it too!
