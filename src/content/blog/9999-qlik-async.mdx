### 0. Intro

* Recap: in the last post we built a synchronous client.
* Problem: when you trigger multiple reloads or need to poll many items, sync = bottleneck.
* Async lets you run **tens or hundreds of requests concurrently** without threads.

### 1. Async foundations

* Why `asyncio` + `aiohttp` over `requests`.
* Key concepts: event loop, coroutines, `async with`.

### 2. Rebuilding the client

* Class `QlikAsyncClient`:

  * Session lifecycle (`__aenter__`, `__aexit__`, `_ensure_session`).
  * GET/POST helpers using `aiohttp.ClientSession`.
  * Concurrency control with `asyncio.Semaphore`.

### 3. Pagination, async style

* `async def query_all` with async iteration.
* Use of `async for` or manual `while` loops with `await`.

### 4. Triggering & polling reloads concurrently

* Kick off N reloads with `asyncio.gather`.
* Poll status for each reload in parallel.
* Add `max_time_s` to bound wait time.

### 5. Error handling & retries

* Use `backoff` with async functions.
* Handling transient network errors, 429s, and expired sessions.

### 6. Notifications (optional advanced)

* Show pattern for injecting an `on_error` callback (e.g., Slack).
* Notify just before raising, without breaking flow.

### 7. Trade-offs and takeaways

* Async = faster when many calls, but more complex.
* Start sync, move to async if:

  * You batch reloads.
  * You hit API throughput limits.
  * You need responsive pipelines.
