## 0. Intro

This is the first post about python performance.
This post will be of how to make python code go faster.

## 1. Exploring python compilers
The first way to improve the python performance is by using different compilers. The most famous ones are:

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <Button label="Cython" link="https://cython.org/" style="solid" />
  <Button label="Pypy" link="https://pypy.org/" style="solid" />
  <Button label="Numba" link="http://numba.pydata.org/" style="solid" />
</div>

**Numba** and **cython** are similar in terms of speed and **pypy** is a little bit slower. You can read more at <FancyLink linkText="How to use Cython, Numba and Pypy" url="https://www.quora.com/How-do-Cython-Numba-and-PyPy-compare-in-terms-of-performance-ease-of-use-and-restrictions"/>.

### 1.1. Cython overview
**Cython** is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex).

When using cython you will need to specify variables classes so the code will look slightly different. For example:

```c
cdef int a = 0
for i in range(10):
    a += i
print(a)
```

You can also cythonize python code. So for example you can create a file to compute Fibonacci series:

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  fib.pyx
</TerminalOutput>
```python
def fib(n):
    """Print the Fibonacci series up to n."""
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b < n:
        print(b, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a + b

    print()
```

And then transform it to **cython**:

```python
from distutils.core import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize

setup(
    ext_modules=cythonize("fib.pyx"),
)
```

Even though cython is fast I don't like having to change the code to adapt it to cython.

### 1.2. Pypy overview

**PyPy** is a fast, compliant alternative implementation of the Python language (2.7.13 and 3.5.3, 3.6). It has several advantages and distinct features:

* **Speed:** thanks to its Just-in-Time compiler, Python programs often run faster on PyPy. (What is a JIT compiler?)
* **Memory usage:** memory-hungry Python programs (several hundreds of MBs or more) might end up taking less space than they do in CPython.
* **Compatibility:** PyPy is highly compatible with existing python code. It supports cffi and can run popular python libraries like twisted and django.
* **Stackless:** PyPy comes by default with support for stackless mode, providing micro-threads for massive concurrency.

When using **pypy** you can write regular python code. The main disadvantage of pypy is that you can't use other libraries out of the box. So if for example you wan to use **pandas** you will need a **pypy** implementation of it. This makes using pypy along common python packages unconvinient. 

### 1.3. Numba overview

**Numba** translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime using the industry-standard LLVM compiler library. Numba-compiled numerical algorithms in Python can approach the speeds of C or FORTRAN.

You don't need to replace the Python interpreter, run a separate compilation step, or even have a C/C++ compiler installed. Just apply one of the Numba decorators to your Python function, and Numba does the rest.

So you can use python code without modifications and you won't have compatibility problems with other packages when using numba. This is the reason I preffer **numba** over **cython** and **pypy** and it is also one of the faster of the three.

## 2. Using numba

**Numba** provides some decorators that will transform functions to `C`. This way the execution times will be faster.

By adding the `jit` decorator to a function **numba** will transform it to `C`. For example:

```python
from numba import jit, njit

@jit
def m_sum(data):
    out = 0
    for x in data:
        out += x

    return out

m_sum([1, 2, 3])
```
<TerminalOutput>
  \> 6
</TerminalOutput>

### 2.1. `jit` vs `njit` decorators

The default **numba** decorator is `jit`. It is possible to pass use nopython mode with `@jit(nopython=True)` or with the decorator `njit` which is equivalent.
`njit` decorator is faster than `jit` but supports less features than jit.

For example you can't cast to string (with for example `str(10)`) inside a `njit` decorated function.
So you should try to use `njit` decorator if possible specialy for numerical calculations.

### 2.2. `vectorize` decorator

Using the `vectorize` decorator, you write your function as operating over input scalars, rather than arrays. **Numba** will generate the surrounding loop (or kernel) allowing efficient iteration over the actual inputs.

So for example given a `np.array` we can calculat the square with the follwing function.

```python
from numba import vectorize

mlist = np.array(range(10))

@vectorize
def square(x):
    return x**2

square(mlist)
```
<TerminalOutput>
  \> array([ 0,  1,  4,  9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81], dtype=int64)
</TerminalOutput>

To increase the speed you can specify the inputs and output dtypes using `int8` since in this example is enough for storing `81` which is the max value.
You can check the <FancyLink linkText="Numpy documentation" url="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/basics.types.html"/> to see the different `dtypes`.

```python
from numba import vectorize, int8

mlist = np.array(range(10))

@vectorize([int8(int8)])
def square(x):
    return x**2

square(mlist)
```
<TerminalOutput>
  \> array([ 0,  1,  4,  9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81], dtype=int8)
</TerminalOutput>

The format for declaring the `dtypes` is `[output(input1, input2, ...)]`.

## 3. Test numba performance

### 3.1. Test `sum` function

First we will time the execution of different `sum` functions. The first option will be a for loop in python:

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  iter_and_sum
</TerminalOutput>
```python
def iter_and_sum(data):
    """ Sums each element in an iterable """
    out = 0
    for x in data:
        out += x

    return out
```

And we will test both `jit` and `njit` **numba** decorators. As an example this is how the `jit` version would be defined:

<TerminalOutput color="stone">
  jit
</TerminalOutput>
```python
@jit
def jit_iter_and_sum(data):
    """ Sums each element in an iterable """
    out = 0
    for x in data:
        out += x

    return out

# Or equivalent:
jit(iter_and_sum)
```

The other options is to use the `sum()` python function and the `numpy.sum()`.

For the tests we will try different array lenghts.

| numpy size | iter_and_sum |      jit |     njit |   np.sum |       sum |
|-----------:|-------------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|
|       10^4 |     0.000926 | 0.000001 | 0.000001 | 0.000008 |  0.000750 |
|       10^5 |     0.009162 | 0.000009 | 0.000010 | 0.000042 |  0.007408 |
|       10^6 |     0.092395 | 0.000106 | 0.000120 | 0.000408 |  0.075894 |
|       10^7 |     0.936200 | 0.002313 | 0.002345 | 0.004393 |  0.766890 |
|       10^8 |     9.335412 | 0.021232 | 0.020506 | 0.042701 |  7.549756 |
|       10^9 |    96.134125 | 0.238718 | 0.225308 | 0.433185 | 76.537118 |

<Notice type="warning">
  First time result has been excluded to avoid computing the time of compilation before calculating the mean.
</Notice>

It is important to mention that the results would be different using python lists instead of `numpy` arrays.

<canvas id="chart_sum" style="width:100%;height:600px;"></canvas>

For small arrays `numpy.sum` is the best option but **for large arrays both `jit` and `njit` perform really well**.

In general is a really good idea to use numpy functions since they use `cython` under the hood.
In all cases using the raw loop `iter_and_sum` or the default python `sum` gives poor results.

<Notice type="success">
  **numba** can be **400x** better than a python loop
</Notice>

### 3.2. Test fix time

At one of the projects I was working at my company I found an intersting problem.
I had a huge dataframe (650 milion rows) and among other columns there was one for the `date` and one for `time`.

The `date` column followed the format `YYYY-MM-DD` like 2019-05-15. The problem was with the `time` column.
The original format was `hhmmsscc` (`c` for centiseconds) and instead of being a string it was presented as an **integer**. So for example you could find the following values:

| value    | represents    |
|---------:|---------------|
| 23411210 | 23:41:12.10   |
|  9051137 | 09:05:11.37   |
|      712 | 00:00:07.12   |

#### 3.2.1. The functions

So to fix that I transformed the values to string, then added 0 until I had 8 chars and finally split and add `:` and `.` so that then it could be transformed.

Let's use this problem for testing **numba**. First let's see all different options I came up.

##### 3.2.1.1. zfill

This was my first approach which was good enough. The idea is to transform the `time` column to string and then apply `zfill(8)`. After that I created a string with the appropiate format and transform the whole `datetime` with `pd.to_datetime`.

```python
def zfill(df):
    """
        1. Transform time to str
        2. zfill
        3. split time as string lists
        4. pd.to_datetime
    """

    aux = df["time"].apply(str).apply(lambda x: x.zfill(8)).str
    return pd.to_datetime(df["date"] + " " + aux[:2] + ":" + aux[2:4] + ":" + aux[4:6] + "." + aux[6:])
```

##### 3.2.1.2. fix_time_individual

The idea in this option is to create a function decorated with `jit` that transform one element of the `time` column and apply the function to the column.

Insted of using `pd.to_datetime` I use `.astype(np.datetime64)` since is faster.

```python
def fix_time_individual(df):
    """
        1. pandas.apply a jit function to add 0 to time
        2. concat date + time
        3. change to np.datetime64
    """
    
    @jit
    def _fix_time(x):
        aux = "0"*(8 - len(str(x))) + str(x)
        return aux[:2] + ":" + aux[2:4] + ":" + aux[4:6] + "." + aux[6:]
    
    return (df["date"] + " " + df["time"].apply(_fix_time)).astype(np.datetime64)
```

##### 3.2.1.3. fix_time_np_string

With this solution I created and empty `numpy` array and filled with a loop inside the `jit` decorated function.

```python
def fix_time_np_string(df):
    """
        1. Use a jit function to add 0 to each time
        2. concat date + time
        3. change to np.datetime64
    """

    @jit
    def _fix_time(mlist):
    
        out = np.empty(mlist.shape, dtype=np.object)

        for i in range(len(mlist)):

            elem = str(mlist[i])
            aux = "0"*(8 - len(elem)) + elem

            out[i] = aux[:2] + ":" + aux[2:4] + ":" + aux[4:6] + "." + aux[6:]

        return out
    
    return (df["date"].values + " " + _fix_time(df["time"].values)).astype(np.datetime64)
```

##### 3.2.1.4. fix_time_np_datetime

In this case the I also create an empty `numpy` array but with `datetime64[s]` dtype. This way I can iterate over both `time` and `date` at the same time.

```python
def fix_time_np_datetime(df):
    """
        1. Iterate time and date with jit function
        2. Transform each element to string and add 0s
        3. Split the string
        4. Cast each element to np.datetime64
    """
    
    @jit
    def _fix_date(mdate, mtime):

        out = np.empty(mtime.shape, dtype="datetime64[s]")

        for i in range(len(mtime)):

            elem = str(mtime[i])
            aux = "0"*(8 - len(elem)) + elem

            aux = mdate[i] + " " + aux[:2] + ":" + aux[2:4] + ":" + aux[4:6] + "." + aux[6:]

            out[i] = np.datetime64(aux)

        return out
    
    return _fix_date(df["date"].values, df["time"].values)
```

##### 3.2.1.5. np_divmod_jit

In this solution I process the `time` column as number and with the `np.divmod` function I create a value that represents a **timedelta**. After transforming the `time` column I change the dtype to `timedelta64[ms]` and sum it to the `date` column as a `datetime64`.

```python
def np_divmod_jit(df):
    """
        1. Iterate time and date with jit function
        2. Use np.divmod to transfom HHMMSSCC to miliseconds integer
        3. Cast date as np.datetime and time to timedelta
        4. Sum date and time
    """
        
    @jit
    def _fix_date(mdate, mtime):

        time_out = np.empty(mtime.shape[0], dtype=np.int32)

        for i in range(mtime.shape[0]):
            aux, cent = np.divmod(mtime[i], 100)
            aux, seconds = np.divmod(aux, 100)
            hours, minutes = np.divmod(aux, 100)

            time_out[i] = 10*(cent + 100*(seconds + 60*(minutes + 60*hours)))

        return mdate.astype(np.datetime64) + time_out.astype("timedelta64[ms]")
    
    return _fix_date(df["date"].values, df["time"].values)
```

##### 3.2.1.6. divmod_njit

It is the same as the previous example but after changing `np.divmod` to the python `divmod` function I can use the `njit` decorator for the first time.

```python
def divmod_njit(df):
    """
        1. Iterate time with njit function
        2. Use divmod to transfom HHMMSSCC to miliseconds integer
        3. Outside the njit function cast date as np.datetime and time to timedelta
        4. Sum date and time
    """

    @njit
    def _fix_time(mtime):

        time_out = np.empty(mtime.shape)

        for i in range(mtime.shape[0]):
            aux, cent = divmod(mtime[i], 100)
            aux, seconds = divmod(aux, 100)
            hours, minutes = divmod(aux, 100)

            time_out[i] = 10 * (cent + 100 * (seconds + 60 * (minutes + 60 * hours)))

        return time_out

    return df["date"].values.astype(np.datetime64) + _fix_time(
        df["time"].values.astype(np.int32)
    ).astype("timedelta64[ms]")
```

##### 3.2.1.7. divmod_vectorize

This case is exactly the same as the previous one but instead of doing the `for` loop I use the **numba** `vectorize` decorator.

```python
def divmod_vectorize(df):
    """
        1. Use divmod to transfom HHMMSSCC to miliseconds integer with vectorize
        2. Outside the njit function cast date as np.datetime and time to timedelta
        3. Sum date and time
    """

    @vectorize([int32(int32)])
    def _fix_time(mtime):

        aux, cent = divmod(mtime, 100)
        aux, seconds = divmod(aux, 100)
        hours, minutes = divmod(aux, 100)

        return 10 * (cent + 100 * (seconds + 60 * (minutes + 60 * hours)))

    return df["date"].values.astype(np.datetime64) + _fix_time(
        df["time"].values.astype(np.int32)
    ).astype("timedelta64[ms]")
```

#### 3.2.2. The results

| size |    zfill | fix_time_individual | fix_time_np_string | fix_time_np_datetime | np_divmod_jit | divmod_njit | divmod_vectorize |

Both `divmod_njit` and `divmod_vectorize` performs really well compared to the other options. Is intersting that my first approach (`zfill`) is the best for small dataframes but it starts to underperform at 10^5.

#### 3.2.3. Speed with different machines

I did this test with up to `10^7` elements with my computer. I was not able to increase the number of elements due to an **out of memory error** (not enough RAM).

Then I repeated everything with an `M64` **azure** machine.

The specs of each machine are:

|             | processor                              | cores | RAM   |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|-------|-------|
| my computer | Intel Core i5-6500 3.2Ghz              | 4     | 16 GB |
| azure M64   | Intel Xeon E7-8890 v3 2.5GHz (Haswell) | 64    | 1 TB  |

Let's compare the results of two functions.

| size | zfill (i5) | zfill (azure) | divmod_vectorize (i5) | divmod_vectorize (azure) |
|-----:|-----------:|--------------:|----------------------:|-------------------------:|
| 10^2 |     0.0040 |        0.0044 |                0.0902 |                   0.0886 |
| 10^3 |     0.0054 |        0.0072 |                0.0917 |                   0.0900 |
| 10^4 |     0.0314 |        0.0304 |                0.1001 |                   0.1013 |
| 10^5 |     0.2917 |        0.2955 |                0.1910 |                   0.1274 |
| 10^6 |     3.1439 |        3.4249 |                1.0513 |                   0.3844 |
| 10^7 |    32.7804 |       37.4349 |                9.7113 |                   2.8040 |


If we take a look at the results we can see that they both perform similar. 

<canvas id="chart_fix_time_comparison" style="width:100%;height:600px;"></canvas>

It is important to remember that **pandas only work with one core** so I am not using the full potential of the machines. **Having more RAM allows to work with more data** but it does not increase the speed. With the **numba** vectorize the azure machine performs better as the size increases.
