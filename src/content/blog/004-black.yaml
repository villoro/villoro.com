  ## What is black

  [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) is python code formatter that allows developers to focus on code itself. You can try it online [here](https://black.now.sh/).


  From their github:

  > Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters.

  ## Installation and usage of black
  
  You can install black using pip by:

  ```sh
  pip install black
  ```

  You can 'black' any python file or directory with:
  ```sh
  # Run on a file
  black file.py

  # Run on a folder
  black src/
  ```

  You can use a `pyproject.toml` file to configure some things in black. For example I like having a 100 line-length, so I would use:
  ```toml
  [tool.black]
  line-length = 88
  py36 = true
  ```

  ## Sublack

  [Sublack](https://github.com/jgirardet/sublack) is a sublime extension to run black. 

  To install sublack you should:

  1. Open sublime
  2. Press `CTRL + SHIFT + P`
  3. Write `Package Controll: Install Package`
  4. Find `sublack`

  After that you can use sublack by:

  * `CTRL + ALT + B`: black the current file.
  * `CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + B`: show a diff file of the changes that black is attempting to do.

  But the best part will be if you set sublack to auto format file when saving. This way every time you save a file if will be blackened. To do so you should:

  1. With sublime go to `Preferences`
  2. Select `Package Settings`
  3. Select `sublack`
  4. Select `Settings`
  5. Change `black_on_save` to `true`

  Note:
  > If you are unable to modify the file, copy it's contents and save it in a new file in the same location (you can see the location at the top of sublime). In my case the path is `C:\Users\Villoro\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\sublack\sublack.sublime-settings`

  I usually use sublime but there are black extensions for other programs as well.
