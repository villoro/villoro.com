## 0. Motivation

Amazon S3 is a powerful, scalable storage solution integral to many workflows. However, storage costs can quickly accumulate, especially when managing large datasets. After migrating some of our jobs from EMR to ECS, S3 storage emerged as our largest expense.

By analyzing our storage usage and implementing targeted strategies, we successfully reduced our S3 costs to one-third, as illustrated in the plot below.

<canvas id="plot-s3-costs" style="width:100%;height:300px;"></canvas>

<Notice type="success" className="mt-6">
  This guide outlines how to export an S3 Inventory and implement Lifecycle Policies to track and optimize your storage expenses effectively.
</Notice>

## 1. Categorizing S3 Costs

### 1.1 Discover S3 Costs with Cost Explorer

The first step is to examine your AWS costs by service using the **Cost Explorer**. This allows you to identify which service to target for cost reduction. In our case, after optimizing EMR costs, S3 became the next clear objective:

<div class="border-2 rounded-md">
  ![AWS Monthly Costs by Service](../../images/posts/2025/0054-aws-costs-by-service.png)
</div>

<Notice type="warning" className="mt-6">
  Focus on reducing costs for the AWS service with the largest expense. Target S3 only if it’s the primary cost driver.
</Notice>

Once you’ve identified S3 as your focus, analyze your S3 expenses by usage type:

<div class="border-2 rounded-md">
  ![S3 Daily Costs by Usage Type](../../images/posts/2025/0054-s3-costs-by-usage-type.png)
</div>

In our case, most costs stemmed from storage. However, in some organizations, high request costs may dominate, often due to numerous small files in a data lake.

</Notice>

### 1.2 Create an S3 Inventory Configuration

**S3 Inventory** is a feature in Amazon S3 that generates scheduled reports containing a comprehensive list of objects in a bucket, along with their metadata. This helps you analyze and manage storage efficiently.

#### 1.2.1. Steps to Set Up S3 Inventory:

1. **Access the S3 Console:**
   Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.

2. **Select Your Bucket:**
   Choose the bucket for which you want to create an inventory report.

3. **Go to Management:**
   In the bucket’s dashboard, select the **Management** tab and scroll down to the **Inventory** section.

4. **Create Inventory Configuration:**
   * Click **Create Inventory Configuration**.
   * Provide a unique name for your inventory.
   * Specify the **destination bucket** where the inventory report will be delivered.

5. **Select Report Content:**
   * Choose the **frequency** of the report: Daily or Weekly.
   * Select the **file format**. For large datasets, export it as `parquet` for optimized storage and processing.
   * Specify the **fields** to include. At a minimum, include object `size`, `storage class`, and `last modified` date.

6. **Review and Save:**
   * Review your configuration.
   * Save it by clicking **Create**.

#### 1.2.2. Notes on Destination Path:

The destination path will include additional folders automatically. For example, if your destination path is `s3://villoro/s3_inventory` for a bucket named `villoro` and inventory name `villoro_inventory`, the final path will be `s3://villoro/s3_inventory/villoro/villoro_inventory/`.

<Notice type="info">
  The first report will be available within 48 hours, and subsequent reports will be generated based on the frequency you selected.
</Notice>

### 1.3 Accessing the S3 Inventory

The S3 Inventory follows a unique structure. Reports are stored at `destination_path/bucket_name/inventory_name/`. The structure includes:

- **Timestamp Folders:** Contain a `manifest.json` listing the `parquet` files for that extraction.
- **Data Folder:** Contains the data files from all exports.
- **Hive Folder:** Includes symlinks to the timestamped folders for easier querying.

#### 1.3.1. Example Structure:

```plaintext
- s3://villoro/s3_inventory/villoro/villoro_inventory/
  ├── 2025-01-09T01-00Z/
  │   ├── manifest.json
  │   └── manifest.checksum
  ├── 2025-01-12T01-00Z/
  │   ├── manifest.json
  │   └── manifest.checksum
  ├── data/
  │   ├── 469e11b1-730b-487b-9110-e0fac5cb4237.parquet
  │   ├── ...
  │   └── 91ee5bf8-c053-4993-b698-ba07009b9060.parquet
  └── hive/

      │   └──symlink.txt
      └── dt=2025-01-12-01-00/
          └──symlink.txt
```

#### 1.3.2. Example Manifest File:

```json
{
  "sourceBucket" : "villoro",
  "destinationBucket" : "arn:aws:s3:::villoro",
  "version" : "2016-11-30",
  "creationTimestamp" : "1736384401000",
  "fileFormat" : "Parquet",
  "fileSchema" : "message s3.inventory {  required binary bucket (STRING);  required binary key (STRING);}",
  "files" : [ {
    "key" : "s3_inventory/villoro/villoro_inventory/data/469e11b1-730b-487b-9110-e0fac5cb4237.parquet",
    "size" : 120112,
    "MD5checksum" : "f0731733165f367e93fa4a51ecc28edb"
  } ]
}
```

## 2. Extracting Data from the Inventory

To create a standard Iceberg table from the non-conventional folder structure of the S3 inventory, we need to process the manifest files, extract the corresponding Parquet data, and then structure it into a usable table. Removing source data after processing is also recommended to optimize storage.

### 2.1 Creating an S3 Inventory Table

The main steps involve:

1. **Reading Manifest Files:** Extract Parquet file paths from each manifest to identify the files corresponding to a specific inventory extraction.
2. **Processing Data:** Read the extracted Parquet files and consolidate the data into a unified table.
3. **Exporting Data:** Export the consolidated data into an Iceberg table for further analysis.
4. **Cleanup:** Remove source data after successful processing to free up storage.

This can be done with:

```python

```

### 2.2 Cleaning the Data with DBT

Below are the four models used to structure and clean the inventory data:

1. **`base_metadata__s3_inventory.sql`:** A base model for renaming and casting fields.
2. **`clean_metadata__s3_inventory.sql`:** Ensures no duplicates and optionally keeps only the latest report.
3. **`int_metadata__s3_inventory.sql`:** Tags paths for better categorization and insights.
4. **`stg_metadata__s3_inventory.sql`:** Final staging model to remove temporary columns and select clean fields.

### 2.3 Analyzing the Inventory

Once the data is consolidated in an Iceberg table, analysis can be customized based on your needs. Examples of what we analyzed:

1. **Categorizing Data:** Analyze different categories of data.
2. **Exploring Folders:** Dive into folder-level details for high-priority categories.
3. **Comparing Layers:** Compare `bronze` and `silver` layers for the same entities to identify discrepancies.

#### 2.3.1. Insights Gained

1. **Ineffective File Deletion:** We found that files in our largest bucket were not being deleted effectively.
2. **Append-Only Tables:** Some `bronze` tables were only appending data without deletions, leading to unnecessary storage costs.

The first issue was addressed with an S3 Lifecycle Policy (details in the next section). The second issue, while significant, is beyond the scope of this post.

## 3. Implement S3 Lifecycle Policies

S3 Lifecycle Policies automate object management to reduce costs. For instance, you can transition objects to cheaper storage classes or delete non-current versions. Here’s how to set them up:

1. **Navigate to Lifecycle Rules:**
   * In the S3 console, go to the **Management** tab of your bucket.
   * Scroll to the **Lifecycle Rules** section and click **Create Lifecycle Rule**.

2. **Define the Rule Scope:**
   * Provide a name for the rule.
   * Specify whether the rule applies to the entire bucket or specific objects (e.g., those with a prefix or tag).

3. **Configure Actions:**
   * **Transition Actions:** Move objects to cheaper storage classes like S3 Standard-IA, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, or S3 Deep Archive after a set number of days.
   * **Expiration Actions:** Delete objects after a specified period.
   * **Non-Current Version Expiration:** Remove older object versions in versioned buckets.

4. **Review and Save:**
   * Review your configuration.
   * Save it by clicking **Create Rule**.

<Notice type="info">
  Non-current version expiration is especially useful for buckets with versioning enabled to minimize storage costs.

By combining S3 Inventory with Lifecycle Policies, you can effectively analyze and manage your storage, ensuring optimal cost efficiency. This approach not only provides visibility into your data but also automates actions to keep your storage expenses under control.
