## 1. Download Windows

Go to https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

Select `Create Windows 11 Installation Media` to download the `MediaCreationTool.exe`.
This will allow you to create a bootable USB.

## 2. Create bootable USB

Use the MediaCreationTool to create a bootable USB.

1. Select language and edition
2. Select `USB flash drive`
3. Select desired USB drive

After this it will:

1. Download needed files to install windows
2. Format the USB
3. Add all needed files to the drive and make it bootable

## 3. Install windows

### 3.1. Select appropiate region for no bloatware

Select `English (World)` or `English (Europe)` for the `Time and Currency forma` setting.

See: https://pureinfotech.com/install-windows-11-without-bloatware-apps/

### 3.2. Clean the disk

After you have selected the region, you will need to decide where to install windows.
I like to go to the `Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)`. With that I can make sure to do a clean install

> Important, this will delete all files in the disk you select.

Select the disk where you want to install windows. If needed, delete the existing partitions and create a new one.

## 4. Set up windows
 
Here we want to create a local account.

**DO NOT CREATE A MICROSOFT ACCOUNT**

### 4.1. OOBEREGION 'error'

If you see the `OOBEREGION` 'error' don't panic. It just means that windows is unable to determine which bloatware to install, just skip that step.

### 4.2. Disable internet

When it asks for a internet connection, hit `SHIFT` + `F10`. A command will appear. Then just write:

```sh
OOBE\BYPASSNRO
```

This will force a reboot and the internet connection will no longer be required.

After the reboot make sure to skip the `OOBEREGION` 'error' again and select the keyboard layout.

When it asks about the internet connection, select `I don't have interent`. Even after selecting that option it will try to convince you to set up a Microsoft account. Just select the `Continue with limited setup`.

From there, you can set up a username and you will have your local account.

## 5. Install programs

Once you are inside windows, you can connect to the internet so that you can start downloading everything you need.

Here everyone has different preferences but there is a way to get the most common programs and install them all at once. Just go to https://ninite.com/ and select the programs you want. Once done, hit `Get Your Ninite` to download an `exe` file that will install them all.

### 5.1. Change the default browser (if wanted)

I don't like `Edge`.

One app that I always download is https://brave.com/.

## 6. Windows updates

Windows updates take a lot of time to install and some times can go wrong. So I think it's best that you download all updates you can so that you have the computer as udpated as possible.

## 7. Check startup apps

Here you might want to disable apps that you don't use so that the computer loads faster. For example you might not be using `Onedrive` (which is installed even if you do the `English (world)` trick) and in that case it would be better to disable it.

To do so open the `Task Manager` and go to `Startup apps`
