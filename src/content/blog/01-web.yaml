  I used to have a personal webpage made with wordpress. Since I have been working as a developer for some years I decided that I could create something that better suited my needs.

  I knew I wanted to create something that was:
  * really fast
  * easy to mantain (by a developer)
  * made from scratch (sine it would help me learn)

  And I ended up creating a webpage with [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and making it a static webpage with [frozen flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/). I also used the power of [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/) templates.

  For the html part I decided to go with [w3css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) since it was an easy way to create a responsive webpage.
