brief: |
  While working with [Basetis](https://www.basetis.com/) I was part of a Service for [Naturgy](https://www.naturgy.com/en/home) (one of the biggest energy company in Spain). In this service I lead a team that was in charge of automation and costs reduction.

  We were able to create a pipeline with [Luigi](https://pypi.org/project/luigi/) that created some reports with [plotly](https://plot.ly/) that used to be created by hand using Power Point. We also automated some repetitive tasks using [selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/).

motivation: |
  Naturgy Inform√°tica, the IT provider for [Naturgy](https://www.naturgy.com/en/home), needed to centralize the professional services provided by different providers in a single service called AM Managers.

  This service would provide control and support tasks of the IT suppliers.

  The main challenges to overcome where:

  <p><i class="fa fa-check v-color-text-accent"></i> to offer quality information </p>
  <p><i class="fa fa-check v-color-text-accent"></i> to have homogeneous indicators </p>
  <p><i class="fa fa-check v-color-text-accent"></i> to establish an efficient management model. </p>

  ## Solution
  We relied on the [ITIL](https://www.axelos.com/certifications/itil-certifications) framework to implement the most appropriate solution, which contemplated various aspects.

  The service was split in two teams. The first one was in charge of managing, controlling and auditing all providers.

  The second team (SMA) was in charge of the Continual Service Improvement (CSI) and its mission was to reduce costs and try to automate the whole service.

  ### SMA Team
  At the beginning of the service I was put in charge of the SMA team which started with only 2 people. The idea was to help the other team become more efficient.

  After one year it was clear that this team was a key part in the service since it grew to almost 10 people.

  ### SMA Tasks
  Before we started the service there were around two people full time doing reports with Power Point. One of the tasks of the SMA team was to automate all those reports.

  For the ETL part we created a pipeline using [Luigi](https://pypi.org/project/luigi/) and for the reports itself a combination of [plotly](https://plot.ly/) and some raw html. This enabled us to automatically create reports that could be viewed offline in both computers and smartphones. We also used [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) for some of those reports.

  Another important task of the team was to automate some repetive tasks done through Naturgy corporative tools. To do so we define some workflows with [selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) which were also triggered with [Luigi](https://pypi.org/project/luigi/).

  Finally we created a bot that enabled the team to interact with [Luigi](https://pypi.org/project/luigi/) through [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/es-es/).

  ## Achievements
  With this service we were able to:

  <p><i class="fa fa-check v-color-text-accent"></i> reduce costs (more than 15%) </p>
  <p><i class="fa fa-check v-color-text-accent"></i> automate reporting needs </p>
  <p><i class="fa fa-check v-color-text-accent"></i> centralize data (CMDB) </p>
  <p><i class="fa fa-check v-color-text-accent"></i> use existing API from the client to interact with their systems </p>
  <p><i class="fa fa-check v-color-text-accent"></i> automatic control of the SLA for each IT Naturgy provider </p>
