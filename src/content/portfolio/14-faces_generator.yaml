brief_markdown: The idea of this project was to use a Generative Adversial Network (GAN) to create new content.

motivation_markdown: |
  This was my fifth and last project of the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). With this project we were asked to create a generative adversarial networks (GAN). The first neural network had to create faces using a random vector and the second one guess which faces were fake and which ones were real.

  ## Results
  The faces generated looks enough realistic. The dataset used to train the network is big (it have around 200k images) so in order to reduce training times I cropped the images to 28 x 28 pixels. In the future I would like to train it without the cropping to see how the network performs.
