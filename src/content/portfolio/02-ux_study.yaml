brief: |
  For my Masters Thesis I did a UX Study focusing on how to create an app to manage personal finances. The main objective of the project was how to successfully design and create an Android App that convey a good UX.

  I followed [Rex Hartson and Pardha S. Pyla's](https://www.amazon.com/UX-Book-Guidelines-Ensuring-Experience/dp/0123852412) guidelines in order to ensure a quality User Experience.

  I also created a working prototype developed with Android Studio including cloud syncronization using SaaS.

  In the next images you can see the different pages of the App I designed and created. You can also see how it evolved from wireframes to sketches and then finally how it looked in the prototype.
