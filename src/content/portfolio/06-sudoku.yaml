brief_markdown: |
  The aim of this project was to create a game agent to solve any diagonal sudoku.

  The sudoku is solved by using both elimination and constrain propagation. And if with this is not enough the agent uses decision trees to explore different scenarios until it reaches a feasible solution.

motivation_markdown: |
  This is one of the projects I did when I was taken the [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/ai-artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd898). The idea with this project was that we understand and develop a solution using elimination and constrain propagation and decision trees.

  ## Result
  The AI created is able to solve any sudoku that have a solution. It can also solve sudokus that have more than one solution but it will only get one of them.
