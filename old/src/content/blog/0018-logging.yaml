  An overview of my own custom logging library that handles console and file output.

  In almost every program that we write we will need to show some output. The first thing that developers use is the `print` function but this lacks some really important features such as providing the time when the message was produced and the ability to save the output to a file. This is way is better to use a `logging`.

  ## 1. pygogo

  As always the first thing you should do when you need something is to look at the existing packages to avoid reinventing the wheel. [pygogo](https://github.com/reubano/pygogo) is a nice python package that is easy to use.

  The key features I think it has are:

  * You can write regular message (low) in one file and error-like messages (high) in another one
  * It can have different formats for `low` and `high`
  * It can be called from different files and handles well the different paths

  What I belive it lacks:

  * Ability to show full information of errors
  * Easy way to have different formats for console handlers and file handlers.

  > So I decided to create my own logging library

  ## 2. v-log

  What I wanted was a `log` that would output good looking messages to the console while writting a properly formatted `csv` for further analysis. It is difficult to achive that with the regular `logging` library so I created `v-log`.

  ### 2.1. Using v-log

  To install it run:

      pip install v-log

  It works similar to the default log:

  ```python
  from v_log import VLogger
  log = VLogger(__name__)

  log.critical("critical")
  log.error("error")
  log.warning("warning")
  log.info("info")
  log.debug("debug")
  ```

  It can also show execution times and errors:
  ```python
  # Show time
  log.info("Test time", time=10)

  # Show error. You need to pass the exception with the 'error' param
  try:
      1 / 0
  except Exception as e:
      log.error("Try errors", error=e)
      log.error("Try errors %s", "full", time=10, error=e)
  ```

  This is what you will see with the above example:

  <div class="w3-center">
    <img src="/static/images/posts/v_log.png" alt="v_log" class="w3-image w3-padding-16" style="max-height: 300px;"/>
  </div>

  > Output in the console will have colors. `debug` is green, info the default color, `warning` is orange and both `error` and `critical` are red.

  ### 2.2. How it works

  `v-log` creates a `VLogger` class that is a wrapper that has 2 logs inside, one for the file output and another one for the terminal. This way if you call `log.info` it will call both `log_terminal.info` and `log_console.info` functions.

  The second intersting part is that you can pass `time` as and argument and it will process it. You can also pass an exception and it will show the **line** where the error happened, the **type** of error and the **details**.

  ### 2.3. Customizating v-log

  When creating the `VLogger` instance you can define:

  <table class="v-table" align="center">
    <tr>
      <th class="v-table-header">param</th>
      <th class="v-table-header">description</th>
      <th class="v-table-header">default</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>module_name</td>
      <td>name of the module</td>
      <td>"base"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>uri_log</td>
      <td>uri of the file where log will be stored</td>
      <td>"log.csv"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>file_log_level</td>
      <td>minimum level of log events in order to be writed</td>
      <td>logging.INFO</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>console_log_level</td>
      <td>minimum level of log events in order to be printed</td>
      <td>logging.INFO</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>csv_separator</td>
      <td>csv separator</td>
      <td>";"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>base_path</td>
      <td>name of the root folder of the execution</td>
      <td>"src"</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  for example you could do:

  ```python
  import logging
  from v_log import VLogger
  log = VLogger(__name__, uri_log="data/log.log", file_log_level=logging.WARNING)
  ```
