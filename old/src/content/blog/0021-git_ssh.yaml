  Learn how to work securely with git by using SSH authentication with github.


content_markdown: |

  **Secure Shell (SSH)** is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. This allows you to connect securely to other services or machines.

  In this post I am going to explain how to configure your linux machine to github using **SSH**.

  ## Table of Contents

  [TOC]

  ## 1. Create **SSH keys**
  
  First we will create a SSH key that will allow you to connect to github.

  ```sh
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```  

  Then I suggest you save the SSH key with some usefull name like `/home/ubuntu/.ssh/github_ssh`

  Finally add a passphrase. This will ensure that your SSH credentials are safe even if someone access your computer.

  ## 2. Use keychain

  > If you are using **Windows** you don't need to do that step.

  The **SSH key** you just created has a passphrase and you probably don't want to write it every time you open a new terminal.

  You can use **keychain** to remember the passphrase.

  ```sh
  sudo apt install keychain
  ```

  First of all some people use **ssh-agent** to add the **SSH keys** but you need to start one every time you open a new terminal and they don't die. So after some time you will end with a lot of ssh-agents running. If you did that you can step them with:

  ```sh
  keychain --stop all
  ```

  > You can check that only one ssh-agent is running with `ps -ef | grep ssh-agent`

  To set up **keychain** edit the `~/.bashrc` file so that **keychain** is started everytime you open a terminal.

  <div class="input">
    ~/.bashrc
  </div>
  ```
  # Add this line at the end
  eval `keychain --agents ssh --eval github_ssh`
  ```

  > `github_ssh` is the name of the SSH key to import you could add more separating them by spaces

  ## 3. Add the SSH key to github

  This guide focus on github but you can do the same following similar steps for other git services like bitbucket.

  1. Copy the content of the `~/.ssh/github_ssh.pub` file.
  2. Go to github settings page.
  3. Select `SSH and GPG keys` section.
  4. Click `add new SSH keys`.
  5. Use some meaningfull name like `aws_ec2`, paste the SSH key and save it.
  6. If asked, write your github password.

  ## 4. Check the SSH conection

  The first thing you should do is to **restart** the terminal so that changes can be applied.

  Run the following command: 

  ```sh
  ssh -T git@github.com
  ```

  The first time it will say that the authenticity of **github.com** can't be established. Enter yes to add it to the list of known hosts so that you won't get asked each time.

  > You should see a message saying `Hi XXXX! You've successfully authenticated`

  ## 5. Cloning a **git** repo

  Since you are using **SSH** the clone command will change a little bit. Instead of using:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/username/repo_name.git
  ```

  You should use:

  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:username/repo_name.git
  ```

  After doing all that you can use git without needing to worry about passwords or passphrases anymore.
