  ## 1. Create a python package

  To work with python you only need a `.py` file. However if you are creating a package you need to follow a concrete structure and include some needed files.

  Before creating your project, I suggest you check if the name you want to use exists:

  ```sh
  pip search package_name
  ```

  > You can also look for it at [pypi web](https://pypi.org/)

  ### 1.1. Structure your project

  You should have your project inside a folder with the name of the package. This will be the `root` of your project and should include `.gitignore`, `README.md` and `LICENSE.txt` among other configuration files.

  The code should be inside another folder with the name of the package. So the structure should be:

  ```
  - /package_name
      ├── /package_name
      │   ├── __init__.py
      │   ├── file1.py
      │   ├── file2.py
      │   └── fileN.py
      ├── .gitignore
      ├── LICENSE.txt
      ├── README.md
      └── setup.py
  ```

  #### 1.1.1. Main files

  All files inside `/package_name/package_name` should have imports that work from the main path. For example to import the `file1` in `file2` you should:

  ```python
  from .file1 import my_function
  ```

  > Do not forget the **'.'** before the name

  The `__init__.py` file will contain whatever you want to call from the 'outside'.

  For example:

  ```python
  from .file2 import public_function
  ```

  This is what will allow you to do the following one you have uploaded the package:

  ```python
  import package_name
  package_name.public_function() # This will call the 'public_function' from 'file2.py'
  ```

  #### 1.1.2. setup.py

  This is where you define the package itself, how can it be installed and some basic information about it. A basic example would be:

  ```python
  import io
  from setuptools import setup

  setup(
      name="package_name",
      version="1.0.2",
      author="Your Name",
      author_email="your@email.com",
      packages=["package_name"],
      install_requires=io.open("requirements.txt", encoding="utf-8").read().splitlines(),
      include_package_data=True,
      license="MIT",
      description=("write here a short description"),
      long_description=io.open("README.md", encoding="utf-8").read(),
      long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
      url="https://github.com/your_user/package_name",
      package_data={"package_name": ["resources/*"]},
  )
  ```

  ##### 1.1.2.1. long_description param
  `long_description` is extracted from the `README.md`

  > you can use other formats for the README like `ost`

  ##### 1.1.2.2. install_requires param
  `install_requires` is a list of requirements. In the example I get it from `requirements.txt`.

  You could also write the requirements by hand with:

  ```python
  install_requires=["pandas>0.22", "flask"]
  ```

  > You should avoid requirements with a fixed number version use `<` or `>` instead.

  ##### 1.1.2.3. package_data param

  The `package_data` parameter allows you to include all files inside `/package_name/resources/` path even if they are not `.py` files. This will be useful if you want to include `html` templates or `yaml`/`json` with data. 

  ### 1.2. Create the package

  Before creating the package I suggest you add some rules in the `.gitignore`:

  ```
  build/
  dist/
  *.egg-info
  ```

  After that you can run:

  ```sh
  python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
  ```

  Then you will have `build` with the content of the package and `dist` with `tar` and `wheels` of the package (what will be uploaded).

  ## 2. Upload the package

  ### 2.1. Requirements

  When you run `pip install package` you are actually downloading it from [pypi](https://pypi.org/). There is also [test.pypi](https://test.pypi.org/) for testing purpouses. So you will need to register:
  
  * [test.pypi](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/)
  * [pypi](https://pypi.org/account/register/)

  To upload the packages I suggest you use `twine`. You can install it with:

  ```sh
  pip install twine
  ```

  ### 2.2. Uploading a package to test.pypi

  You can run the next command which will upload all packages created in the `dist` folder:

  ```sh
  python -m twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
  ```

  > The first time you run this command you will be asked to log in. Use the credentials from the previous step.

  After uploading the package you can download it to test if it is working as expected:

  ```sh
  pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ package_name

  # You can specify the version with
  pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ package_name==X.X.X
  ```

  ## 2.3. Uploading a package to pypi

  In order to upload the package to `pypi` the process is very similar to the step before:

  ```sh
  python -m twine upload dist/*
  ```

  And to install it you can simply run:

  ```sh
  pip install package
  ```

  > Well done, you now have your first python package uploaded to **pypi**.
