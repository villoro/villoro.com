brief_markdown: |
  The aim of this project was to work with Natural Language Processing (NLP)

  To practise with NLP I created a neural network that was able to generate a new Simpson's episode script.

  The network created was a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short.term Memory (LSTM) cells.

motivation_markdown: |
  This was my third project of the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) and the first one about NLP. The aim was that we got to understant RNN and the implementation of LSTM using tensorflow.

  ## Results
  After some training the network was able to produce plausible text. The generated text is correctly structured as a conversation where there is a person speaking and the sentence has all punctuation needed.

  The only problem is that the script lacks coherence between sentences.

  Here you can see a sample of the generated text:

  ```
  moe_szyslak:(tough) homer, the mob is puttin' the screws on me, see...
  lisa_simpson: we can get a dad."
  marge_simpson: you're a little more" milk of amnesia."
  moe_szyslak: c'mon, homer. you're a remote."
  homer_simpson: i read in that real with your money me back...
  moe_szyslak: hey, this is a knife that's song for the house.
  moe_szyslak:(embarrassed) we should be dead!
  moe_szyslak:(excited) my campaign is a lot of two too thing.

  moe_szyslak:(stunned) oh, my car! thank you!
  moe_szyslak:(proudly) i told you, when i get a rough day.
  moe_szyslak:(impressed) no, okay, boxing.
  moe_szyslak:(to moe, gasps) i don't know if you don't know...
  seymour_skinner:(quickly) man, look, i haven't seen the best book you've ever been in the world.
  moe_szyslak: hey, hey, that's what you...
